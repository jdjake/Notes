\section

The mathematical epoch occuring in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century have an essentially unified character. The most important development was the differential and integral calculus, occuring around 1700, used to study mechanics and astronomy. Klein believes this epoch reached it's high point was Lagrange's \emph{Analytical Mechanics} (1788), and Laplace's \emph{Celestial Mechanics} (5 Volumes, 1799-1825). A summary of integral calculations known at the time is found in Legendre's \emph{Exercises in Integral Calculus} (3 Volumes, 1811-1819).

Besides the devlopment of applied mathematics, this epoch is also notable for Newton's \emph{Enumeration of Lines of Third Order}, in which he classifies the cubic planar curves, and the works of Euler and Lagrange, who developed the theory of algebraic equations, number theory, and the addition theorem for elliptic integrals.
