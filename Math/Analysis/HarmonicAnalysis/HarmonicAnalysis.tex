\section{Homogenous Banach Spaces}

We finish our basic discussion of Fourier summation with a theorem employing the more abstract parts of functional analysis to generalize the convergence properties of good kernels. We saw a Banach space $X$ is a {\bf Homogenous Banach space} if it is a translation invariant subset of $L^1(\mathbf{T})$, with $\| \cdot \|_X \gtrsim \| \cdot \|_1$, and $\| T_t f \|_X = \| f \|_X$ for all $f$ and $T_t$. Finally, we require that $t \mapsto T_t f$ is continuous for each fixed $f \in X$.

\begin{theorem}
	For any good kernel $K_N \in C(\mathbf{T})$, and $f \in X$, $f * K_N \to f$ in $X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Basic analysis shows that if a map $\phi: [0,2\pi] \to X$ is continuous, then
%
\[ \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 1}^N \phi(2\pi m/N) \]
%
exists in the $X$ norm, ala the Riemann integral. We define this to be the `Riemann integral' of $\phi$, i.e.
%
\[ \int_0^{2\pi} \phi(x)\; dx \]
%
This definition obeys all the finite additivity properties of the origin Riemann integral. Further basic approximations prove that if $K_N$ is a good kernel, then
%
\[ \lim \int K_N(x) \phi(x)\; dx = \phi(0) \]
%
If the map $x \mapsto f_x$ is continuous in the $X$ norm, then
%
\[ \lim \int K_N(x) f_x\; dx = f \]
%
But since the $X$ norm upper bounds the $L^1$ norm, $x \mapsto f_x$ is continuous in the $L^1$ norm, and it is easy to see that the $L^1$ value of $\int f_x K_N(x)\; dx$ is $f * K_N$, so we conclude that $f * K_N$ converges to $f$ in the $X$ norm.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The trigonometric polynomials contained in $X$ are dense, and for any closed, translation invariant subspace $Y$ of $X$, $f \in Y$ if and only if for every $n$ for which $\widehat{f}(n) \neq 0$, there is $g \in Y$ such that $\widehat{g}(n) \neq 0$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The techniques of the proof above show that if $f \in C(\mathbf{T})$, and $g \in X$, then $f * g \in X$. In particular, this means that the convolutions of any $g \in X$ with an exponential function is contained in $X$. In particular, the trigonometric polynomials spanned by these exponentials must be dense in $X$. The fact about $Y$ is then obvious.
\end{proof}

Examples of homogenous spaces include $C(\mathbf{T})$, with uniform convergence, $C^n(\mathbf{T})$, with uniform convergence of the first $n$ derivatives, and $L^p(\mathbf{T})$, for $p < \infty$. Unfortunately, however, the space $L^\infty(\mathbf{T})$ fails to satisfy the fact that $t \mapsto f_t$ is uniformly continuous, with a counterexample provided by letting $f$ be the characteristic function of an interval. Similarily, the space of $\alpha$ Lipschitz continuous functions for $0 < \alpha < 1$ also does not satisfy this continuity property.

However, if $X$ is any space satisfying the properties of a homogenous Banach space except for the continuity of translation, the space of functions for which translation {\it is} continuous form a closed subspace which is a homogenous Banach space. In the case of $L^\infty(\mathbf{T})$, this subspace is precisely $C(\mathbf{T})$. For the $\alpha$ continuous functions, these functions are precisely those $f$ for which
%
\[ \limsup_{h \to 0} \frac{|f(t+h) - f(t)|}{|h|^\alpha} = 0 \]
%
For $\alpha = 1$, this space is again $C(\mathbf{T})$.
