(1940) Myth of Sisyphus
	- The goal of the essay is to resolve the problem of whether one should kill oneself, without using an external system of values (e.g. religion).
		- This is the most important question. People do not kill themselves over proofs of the existence of god, or scientific reasoning, but they do kill each other over the reason for living.

	- Since it is legitimate to contemplate the meaning of life, it is legitimate to contemplate the meaning of death, i.e. whether one should end one's life.
	- Conclusion of Essay: Suicide is not legitimate even as an atheist.

	- In such an emotional subject, a learned and classical way of thinking must give way to more intuitive reasoning.
		- The worm that makes someone commit suicide is in the heart, not the mind. How do we go from a lucid knowledge of existence to being whilling to commit suicide?
			- There is not really a rational reason why someone decide to kill themselves (people rarely kill themselves by reflecting on their existence).
			- Someone might kill themselves because their friend addressed them indifferently today. A single act can release the floodgates that have been held within. These isn't really a rational explanation for why a suicide happens.
				- The reason that this is true is that logic can rarely be followed to the bitter end. Men who die by their own hand consequently follow to its conclusion their emotional inclination, not a logical conclusion.
				- This is true of most philosophers as well. When existentialists realize that the world is not understandable, they let go of logic, and retreat to more tractable waters. To understand the absurd we must stay in the state of realizing the world is not understandable rather than retreating to hope.
					- There is a hiatus between what we fancy we know and what we really know. So long as the mind does not act in the world it can keep all its thoughts in perfect harmony but as soon as the mind acts this harmony is destroyed.
					- Almost all the nihilist philosophers find reason to hope in the meaningless of life, an almost religious quality.
						- Is it really true that the absurd gives us a meaning to live? That destroying the reasonable nature of the world gives us a greater understanding of the world? This seems a paradox. Understanding the absurd dispels the feeling of the absurd.
			- Does it follow from this that there is no relation between our opinion of the value of our life and the act to leave it?

		- Suicide is a confession of the truth that has been held within. That the good is not the bad. Life is suffering, and suicide is the confession that there is no meaning for this suffering.
			- Most of us continue making the gestures to live without seriously considering the problem. "The Sleep Necessary to Life".
			- Men delude themselves with hope, either of a life beyond death, or an idea in life that will give life meaning.
				- Part of this is a bias, we only experience the concious part of life, not the unconcious part of life.
	
	- In a world divested of illusions, a man feels alien. He disassociates from his 'act'. This is the realization of `the absurd'.
		- The odd state of soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the habit of life is broken.
		- Realization of the absurd often occurs in the most common of situations.
			- e.g. when we ask "why?" we follow certain habits, e.g. drive to work, eat food, drive home, sleep, repeat, we are dealing with the absurd. Weariness is an encounter with the absurd. Weariness has a bad connotation, but Camus thinks it is good because it brings awareness to the habits we follow.
			- e.g. when we place ourselves at a particular time, we might realize that we have to travel to the end of our time. Tomorrow is both where our hope and dreams lie, as well as our death. 
			- e.g. when we look at a beautiful landscape and realize how alien it is to us (we will never understand the rocks and trees). We realize that we only understood this beauty in images provided to us by society, e.g. we understand atoms by analogy with planets, which is also an image. This is poetry, not true understanding.

		- A good metaphor is a man with a sword attacking a group of men with machine guns. His intention and the reality is contadictory.

		- An encounter with the absurd can set off a chain of thoughts, that either ends in suicide, or recovery (back to habit?)

		- If we are to be honest with ourselves, our actions must follow from a belief in the absurdity of existence.
			- Absurdity is the only way to connect our mind to the physical universe. It is the only logic through which existence is capable.

			-Does it follow that we should commit suicide?
				- No. Just because there is no reason to live does not mean there is a reason to die.
	
		- Absurdity only exists by comparison between a fact vs. a reality.
			- It is a contradiction between our need for unity and reason, and the fractured nature of the universe.

			- spiritual attitude of the enlightenment: all is reason. It is certainly paradoxical to give rational reasons to a world no main guiding principle.
			- phenomenology also fails here. Conciousness only focuses attention on particular sensory data. It cannot unify everything it can sense and thereby understand experience. 
			- The absurd cannot be suppresed by denying one of the terms in its equation.

	- Many people who don't think life is worth living keep living after a suicide attempt. "if I accept the Nietzschean criterion (preach by example), they think “yes” (life is worth living) in one way or another".
	- People who commit suicide also are assured of the meaning of life.

	- The correct question is really "Is there a point to death, i.e. to kill yourself"?
