# The Problems of Philosophy
# By Bertrand Russell



## Quotes:

Philosophy, if it cannot *answer* so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of *asking* questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.

All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctivel. Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.

Most philosophers, rightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than this -- that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attianable, concerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of ultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest function we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and certainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequecy of common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that philosophical problems involve.

The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings it neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.

When Swift invites us to consider the race of Struldbugs who never die, we are able to acquiesce in imagination. But a world where two and two make five seems quite on a different level. We feel that such a world, if there were one, would upset the whole fabric of our knowledge and reduce us to utter doubt.

We do not know who will be the inhabitants of London a hundred years hence; but we know that any two of them and any other two of them will make four of them.

The world of being is unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder of metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries, without any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything that can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to the value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall prefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. The one we do not prefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and hardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real. But the truth is that both have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real, and both are important to the metaphysician.

But for the fact of memory in this sense, we should not know there was a past at all, nor should we be able to understand the word 'past', any more than a blind man can understand the word "light". Thus there must be intuitive judgements of memory.

As it is, the test of coherence condemns the dreams, and confirms the waking life.








## Chapter Notes

### Chapter 1: Appearance and Reality

We begin with the following question: Is there any knowledge no 'reasonable' person could doubt? To answer this question, it is natural to begin with what we experience, since some knowledge must be obtained through experience. But if we think critically, we see that almost any knowledge we are predisposed to infer from sensations is incorrect. For instance, in observing a table, it is self evident to us all that the table is brown, rectangular, shiny, smooth, cool, hard to the touch, and makes a distinctive sound when tapped. But all of these facts may be doubted via reason, from which we will come to the conclusion that these properties are not properties of the table itself, but of the *appearance* of the table which we percieve through the senses. Let us argue why this is so:

- We all agree the table is brown. But if we change the lighting in the room, the precise colour of brown will change. If we fix the lighting, and move around the room, the color of the table will appear to change. The color of the table is also not homogeneous, and so because of the perspective change no two vantage points will give the same distribution of colors which make up the table. A color blind person would not be able to identify that the table is brown, so that without an internal faculty of color-sensing, we would not be able to sense the color of the table. Thus the brownness which makes up the color of the table seems not to be an inherent property of the table, but a property relating to the combination of the table, the lighting of the room it lies in, and the spectator experiencing the color of the table.

- The table appears smooth to our natural senses, but if we examine the table under a microscope, we see via a finer resolution that the table is jagged and rough. We might then feel like this is the *canonical* texture of the table, though zooming in would reveal the table is made from a discrete arrangement of atoms rather than a continuous structure. Thus the smoothness of the table is not a property of the table, but is a property both of the table, and the type of perception we use to experience the table.

- The table appears rectangular, but unless we view the table from a birds eye view, the table never *is* rectangular in our vision. We only come to see it as rectangular because we are practiced at reconstructing the shape of the table from the projection of the table onto our retina. Thus the rectangular shape of the table is perceived not just through the appearance of the table, but from our ability to rearrange these appearances into a rectangular form.

- Pressing on the table shows it is hard, though if we pressed hard enough, the table would crack in half. Similarily, the sound that a table makes when it is tapped on changes depending on how hard we tap the table. Thus the sensation of hardness we experience depends on how hard we press on the table. This goes to show that what we experience of the table is only a potential sign of some property of the table in itself, which causes these sensations. But there is no way to percieve these properties directly.

We conclude from this analysis that the senses do not tell us what is *true* of the table 'in itself', but only what is true about the *appearance* of the table. The table is not immediately known to us, but only inferred from an appearance in our senses. To reason about these things, let us make some definitions of some terms. We call those things *sense data* which are immediately known via sensation, such as colors, sounds, feelings experienced by touch, and so on. *sensation* is the mental process of being immediately aware of sense data.

Our doubt as to our ability to experience a physical object 'in itself' leads to the following questions:	
	
- Is there a real table at all?
- Do *physical* objects exist? We call the collection of all physical objects *matter*, so we can rephrase the last question as asking whether matter exists.
- What constitutes a physical object, and what are the nature of physical objects?

As a preliminary definition of 'matter', let us think of something which is opposed to 'mind', i.e. something which takes up physical space, and is independent of a mind, i.e. incapable of thought or consciousness. Thus these questions boil down to whether there exists something that is not just a mind, or an idea of the mind. The arguments above show that we can only know physical objects through sense-data, but physical objects cannot be composed of sense-data, because, as we have reasoned above, sense-data cannot be a direct property of physical objects, but is a property depending on a physical object and our faculties of perception.

In the book "Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists" (1713), Irish bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) undertook arguments to prove that matter does not exist, since the assumption that matter exists leads to various paradoxes. Thus in his view, the world consists solely of minds and their ideas. Some arguments here are more confusing than others, and so Russell does not really agree the book proves solidly that matter does not exist. But the main realization is that it is not irrational to believe that matter does not exist, and that if there are things that exist independently of us, we cannot percieve them immediately, but only their appearances through sensation. Berkeley does not deny that there is something else other than our minds and our ideas, but he denies that this other thing is non-mental (if all that existed was in our own minds, things that are not immediately sensed cease to exist, a fact that leads to several confusing consequences we will come to later). Berkeley just doesn't think that things other than our mind could be that different from our own mind and it's ideas. Philosophers agreeing with this point are called *idealists*. Berkeley concludes that objects which appear permanent are ideas in the mind of god, who is always vigilant of those objects, and through this vigilance keeps all things in existence. Thus in some sense, Berkeley admits the existence of matter, though this matter is just a family of ideas in the mind of god. Leibnitz (1646-1716), another idealist, argued that what appears as matter to us is a 'colony of souls', perhaps these souls being simpler in complexity to that of the human mind, but a mind nonetheless. Thus, functionally speaking, Leibnitz also admits the existence of matter as a certain subfamily of ideas in another's mind.





### Chapter 2: The Existence of Matter

In this chapter we try and elaborate on the problem of the existence of matter. In particular, we confront the idea of whether these is anything independant of our mind at all. Our main conclusion is that though we will not be able to strictly prove that everything does not emerge from the mind, there is no reason to suppose that it does.

The one thing we can start our discussions with certainty about is that we do experience sensation. It is the cause of sensation that can be doubted. To determine what else is certain, we try and use the system of *systemic doubt* as developed by Rene Descartes (1596-1650), who decided that in his philosophical investigations, he would only believe something unless it was true clearly and distinctly. Anything he could reasonably doubt, he would doubt. In his investigations of this method, he came to the conclusion that the only existence he could be certain of was his own existence. For instance, it is possible, though perhaps improbable, that there is a demon could give us any arrangement of sense-data to convince of a logically consistent outer reality without any such reality existing, so it is reasonable to doubt the existence of this reality. But Descartes existence and the existence of his experience, could not be doubted, for otherwise he could not be decieved in his own senses. This is the famous 'Cogito Ergo Sum' argument, which Descartes thought provided a solid base to begin the pursuit of knowledge.

The problem is that we cannot be sure of anything outside of the fact that we exist at the current moment, and experience things at this moment. Anything else can be doubted. For instance, we might be certain we exist, but we cannot be certain that we 'existed'. It is possible that the universe sprang into existence five miliseconds ago, with all signs of the past, including our memories, created at that instant (this is called the five minute hypothesis). So we cannot even be certain that we existed in the past. When we have experience of sensations that common sense attributes to a table, it is possible that we are being tricked by a demon. But if we believe that there is nothing that exists apart from sense data, we arrive at certain paradoxical conclusions. If a table only exists by virtue of our sensation, this means that when we close our eyes, the table ceases to exist. Of course, Descartes method tells us this is possible. We must not necessarily be frightened by conclusions that defy common sense. Indeed, in some sense this experience is possible even in the realm of common sense, since we can dream of objects that have no physical reality, and we do not realise this until we wake up from that dream (but we note that we do not deny the existence of the *sense-data* that composes the dream, just the cause of that sense-data, i.e. when we see a ghost, we do not doubt the existence of the sense-data of the ghost, but we deny the existence of a physical 'ghost' which causes us to sense a ghost).

So it is logically possible to believe that all that exists is our mind and it's ideas. But there is no *reason* to believe this is the case, and it leads to a less simple explanation for sensations, for reasons we now detail:
	
- One utility of the existence of physical matter is that it provides us with a family of public 'neutral' objects that all other minds can collectively percieve. Sense-data is completely private to each individual. You might tell someone about your sense data, but they obtain their own separate sense-data from the sensation of hearing you talk about your sense data. If no objects existed apart from sense-data, no collectively shared experience could be possible. However, while this makes the existence of physical matter useful functionally, we cannot necessarily appeal to the testimony of other's sense-data in an argument about the existence, because to do so would imply we have some way of being certain of another mind's private sense-data. We cannot access another mind's sense-data, only their testimony of that sense data, which forms our own sense-data, so this argument does not prove that physical objects exist, only that shared experience would be impossible otherwise.

- On the other hand, it does seem that our sensations are a relation between the faculty of our mind's perception, and physical objects. Thus if physical objects do not exist independently of our mind, we cannot ever obtain evidence about the existence of other independant minds from our own, since we infer the existence of other minds from their bodies. Thus we can only know of the existence of other minds if physical matter exists.

- If we doubt the existence of things other than our mind, sensation, and ideas, then we require a very complex theory of how the objects in our mind change over time. If a cat moves from one side of the room to the other while our eyes are closed, then, assuming external existence, we can explain this phenomenon by stating that the cat was in a family of intermediate positions across the room while our eyes are closed. But if we only believe in the mind, sensation, and our ideas, then we must agree that the cat has teleported from one side of the room to the other (it did not exist while our eyes were closed), and it is difficult to obtain an explanation of this fact. If we go to work, our cat no longer exists, so it appears complicated to explain how, when we return from work and the cat exists again, it has become hungry. An explanation for this behaviour seems incomprehensible unless we assume the existence of something independent to our mind.

- When we hear humans speak, it is very difficult to imagine that what we are percieving is not the output of another mind. A similar phenomenon can occur in dreams, but dreams seem to reflect the ideas we sense in our everyday life before we dream. So it appears natural to believe in the existence of other human minds.

- Descartes argument that our inability to tell when we are in a dream implies it is rational to doubt physical experience does not imply it is *necessary* to doubt physical experience. This is because dreams can be accounted for through physical theories and phenomena, which means that we can predict that some sensory experiences do not correspond directly to physical objects.

Ultimately, belief in things external to the mind is instinctual. The discovery that we cannot perceive objects independantly of our mind does not contradict this belief. No paradoxes seem to emerge either. On the other hand, it seems to simplify the way we see the world. Thus we should believe in things external to the mind. This is a general strategy behind many epistemological arguments. All knowledge is built upon instincts, and if we reject all instincts, no knowledge is left. It is possible that these instincts may be false, but through *reason* we cannot reject a belief unless it contradicts another, more strongly held belief. Once we have elaborated the relations between the beliefs, we should accept those that are most possible, or most simple. Is is then possible that we may as a result believe something that is not true, but the likelihood of this diminishes as we continue to elaborate the relation between our beliefs and other beliefs, and form systemic knowledge that is true in relation to each of its parts. It is not as strong an argument as a mathematical proof, but it's the best we've got.

The goal of philosophy is to perform the process of clarifying, relating, and systemizing instinctual beliefs, and to show that those we should believe do not clash, but rather harmonize with one another. Other philosophers believe a stronger goal, i.e. that philosophy can be used to achieve certain knowledge about the fundamental nature of reality and the universe. Russell doubts this goal, but it certainly seems possible to accomplish the more modest goal, which is still important enough to justify the study of philosophy.





### Chapter 3: The Nature of Matter

In the previous chapter, we came to the conclusion that we should believe that our sense data corresponds to something external to ourselves. There is something else which causes the appearances we obtain through sensation. So now we ask, what are the properties of that other thing?

Modern science has come to the view that the fundamental properties of physical matter are *motion* through space and time. Science does not deny that physical matter may have other properties, but at this moment, these appear to be the only properties of physical matter which explain our sensations of physical matter. We re-emphasize that these properties of physical matter cannot be directly accessed by our senses. This can lead to some confusion:
	
- When we say light is a wave, we must distinguish the sensation of light that we experience, from the physical object, which is a wave, and causes the sensation of light. A man who was completely blind could probably never come to terms with the sensation that comes from experiencing light, but could come to an understanding of the theoretical physical wave that causes the sensation of light.

- We should be very careful in our definition of motion through space and time, because, while it is essential that matter lies in space, because the motion of objects happens through space, but the space that we infer from our senses and intuitions is *not* the space that these objects lie in, which is independent of our senses. We might expect our internal notion of space to correspond to external features of space, but this is not necessary, and these two notions of space are not identical.

- The distinction between internal and external time is perhaps more intuitive. We can percieve some events as shorter or longer depending on whether we are excited or bored, though external time is independent of our emotions. Nonetheless, it seems that internal and external time both agree on the relations between two events, i.e. whether events happened before or after. We must be slightly careful on this point, when we see lightning, and then hear thunder, we are still allowed to think of the physical causes of these sensations as happening at the same time; it is the event of percieving these events which happens before and after one another. Similarily, if the sun were to go out, we would not experience the effects of this happening until eight minutes after this event. This is a further reminder that our internal notion of time can only directly percieve when sense-data was obtained, and cannot percieve external time.

If our sensations to be causes by physical objects, then our senses must be percieved through physical objects, *sensory organs*, so we can parameterize the way our perceptions change as the location of our sensory organs changes, e.g. we do not see an object when it goes behind another object from the physical location of our eyes. We feel an object when our fingers come suitably close to that object, and so on. We can only know the relations between the properties of physical objects that cause our sensations to appear.

It remains to ask if there is anything else we can know about the intrinsic nature of physical objects. The common sense hypothesis is that the intrinsic nature of physical objects, though certainly not identifiable with our mental picture of space and time, agree as like as is possible. As we have seen previously, we still have no basis for assuming that objects have an intrinsic color that agrees with what we see, since we have argued that this color changes depending on how we see the object.






### Chapter 4: Idealism

Different philosophers view idealism slightly differently. For our purposes, by idealism we mean the belief that whatever exists must be mental. Despite that common sense tells us this is obviously absurd, this belief is widely held by philosophers (at least in the 1920s, when this book was written). And we have seen that this belief is not entirely groundless, because we can never directly percieve physical objects in themselves, so whatever properties these physical objects have must be absurd relative to what we actually percieve.

The normal arguments upon which idealism is advocated is that there are certain conditions which are required for us to know things, and these conditions necessitate idealism. Let us start with Berkeley's approach. He defines an *idea* to be anything which is known immediately. For instance, colors we see or voices we hear are ideas, but also memories or imaginations. Anything we know externally to us consists of ideas. Anything that is possible to know must therefore be 'in the mind', and so there are no grounds for supposing that there is anything else that is real but ideas, whether our own, or of another individual. A tree continues to exist when no individual sees it because God percieves it for us. The tree continues to exist as long as God continues to percieve it. The main problem in Russell's mind with this argument is a confusion between sensation and sense-data. Undoubtably, both sensation and sense-data occur in the mind. But a sensation is caused *by something*, and it is not necessarily true that this cause is a mental object.

Another, very similar argument starts with what appears to be a self-evident proposition, that we cannot know any thing exists unless we know it in itself, and thus anything that is relevant to our experience must be possible to be known, and thus be mental. This is a more difficult argument to refute, and we will come back to it in time.

Come back to the last page or two later on - I didn't understand it.








### Chapter 5: Knowledge by Acquaintance vs Knowledge by Description

In the previous chapters, we have found that we should distinguish between two types of knowledge. The first, knowledge *of things*, and the second, knowledge *of truths*, often called judgements. Knowledge of a thing through direct awareness, without any inference of knowledge of truths, we shall call *an acquaintance*, so that we have certain *knowledge by acquaintance*. Thus we have direct acquaintance with sense-data. Knowledge by acquaintance is more simple than any knowledge of truths, logically independent, and complete. Once we see a particular shade of color, we know that sense-data utterly and completely.

To contrast knowledge of objects via acquaintance, we cannot be acquainted with physical objects. We only have knowledge of these objects through the sense-data which we believed are caused, in part, by these objects. Because knowledge of physical objects can only be inferred from judgements, this makes knowledge of these objects a degree more complicated than objects known through acquaintance. We therefore know of the table via *knowledge by description*, i.e. we associate the object with a family of judgements we are acquainted with, so that the object is uniquely identified by these judgements. As an example, judgements such as the statement "This particular chair is the cause of the color I am acquainted with" describe a physical object by description.

Question: Without the notion of cause and effect, is there no way of obtaining knowledge of physical objects?

There must be other things we are acquainted with than sense-data, for otherwise we could not know very much at all:

- Once we no longer have sense-data, we are no longer acquainted with the sense data. We are instead acquainted with the *memory* of hte sense data. Thus memories provide another family of objects to which we are acquainted. Memory is necessary for knowledge of the past, for without an acquaintance with memory we would never even know a past existed.

- We are acquainted with the mental experience of awareness, i.e. we have an acquaintance with *introspection*. When I see the sun, I am also aquainted with the mental process of seeing the sun. We are also aware of other mental processes, like our feelings of pleasure, pain, and other emotions. We call this ability to introspect *self consciousness*.

It is important, however, to note that we are not really conscious of *ourself*, but consciousness of thoughts, feelings, and desires, rather than consciousness of the "I". The question of whether we are acquainted with ourselves is a more difficult question, which should be disentangled from acquaintance with thoughts and feelings.

- Acquaintance with the mental act of perception is really an acquaintance with a *relation*, i.e. a relation between sense-data, and the perciever. It is a strange judgement, that we can be acquainted with this relation, and not be directly acquainted with one of the objects in the relation, i.e. the I which acts as the perciever in this situation. But there are arguments for and against acquaintance with ourself.

- In order to be able to make judgements, we need other acquaintance with another family of objects, called *abstract ideas*, or *universals*. Every sentence in the English language contains a universal, since all verbs have universal meaning. We return to this notion later. Thus not everything that we are acquainted with is a particular, existential object.

Let us now focus on knowledge by description. A *description* is any phrase of the form *a BLAH* (an *ambiguous* description) or *the BLAH* (a *definite* description). An object is *known by description* when we know that it is the only object with a certain property. It is generally implied that if an object is known by description, it is not known by acquaintance, i.e. we have *merely descriptive knowledge* of that object. Knowledge by description of our chief importance, for it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience and gain knowledge about the world around us.

When we say "The BLAH exists", we are saying there is a single object which satisfies the property described by BLAH, and no other object also satisfies this proeprty. Common words are usually descriptions in disguise. Let us suppose we make some statement about Otto von Bismarck. Provided we can be acquainted with the "I", Bismarck himself may have this statement to designate the individual who he was directly acquainted with. Thus the name fits the use it wishes to have, i.e. a description that refers to an existing object. But any other individual uses the name in a different way, in describing an object they have heard other people call that name through their ears. That person was acquainted with sense data, which was inferred to be caused by Bismarck's mind and body, and a description was formed in the mind as to the body and mind that causes this sense data. It is an important point that any applicable description must be connected to something that we are directly acquainted with (i.e. sense data), e.g. "the past" is an object that is only applicable in relation to our memory, "the present" in relation to our sense-data, if we are to obtain any information about the object that description refers to except that which follows logically from the description. On the other hand, logical matters need not be concerned with descriptions that refer to particular objects.

Question: What acquaintances does 'the future' connect to?

Question: How does Bayesian reasoning 'correctly quantify' induction?







### Chapter 6: On Induction

We now know that we know that what we are acquainted with exists, and that what we once knew existed in the past. Objects we are acquainted with give us our *data*. If we are to draw inferences from this data, we must have some general principles that allow us to do so, i.e. rules that enable us, from the existence of one object A, to infer the existence of some other object B. Without these principles, we would never be able to know anything beyond what we are acquainted with.

We are all convinced that the sun will tomorrow. But why is this a reasonable belief? The natural answer is "because it has risen every other day in the past". We might also reference certain physical laws of motion, i.e. that objects continue to rotate unless there is some outside interference. Though we might doubt our ability to know no interference has taken place, we do not dwell on this doubt. Today the interesting question is whether it is legitimate to doubt our knowledge that physical laws remain the same day after day.

Experience has shown that the repetition of some act *causes* us to believe it will happen in the future. Despite that these beliefs can be misleading (a chicken who is fed every day by a man is eventually strangled by that man) we certainly still believe them in many circumstances. Thus we have an instinct for this belief. But this is not necessarily grounds to determine if such acts are reasonable.

Thus we must investigate that validity of the principle of "the uniformity of nature", the belief that everything that has happened, or will happen, is an instance of some general law. General rules that appear to have exceptions are really replaced by more general rules that account for these exceptions. The business of science is to find these correct uniformities about the physical world.

One argument that the future is like the past is that the future eventually becomes the past, so that the past is really just an experience of what was once the future, and so it is natural for the past to tell us about the future. But there are problems with this argument. At the present moment, we only have experience of these *past futures*, and not the *future futures*. So the argument that future futures resemble past futures is not resolved. The problem of the uniformity of nature does not necessarily necessite a discussion of the future, because there are events in the present that we have no sense data of immediately, so we can still discuss whether the physical properties of the world are uniform at the present moment, throughout all of space.

To be more precise, when we use these arguments are apply the principle of induction. The first way of stating a version of the principle is that, if objects of type A have, in the past, always been associated with objects of type B, then it is reasonable to believe that, given an object of type A, there will be an associated type B. The more often we have seen this association, the more strongly we hold a belief about this association. Another version of the principle is that it is then more reasonable to believe in the *general law* of association, rather than a belief in a particular instantiation of the law.

We cannot use experience to disprove the principle of induction. Nor can we use experience to prove the principle of induction, because the induction principle only gives us knowledge about objects which have not yet to have been sensed directly. As soon as we see an object of type A that is not associated with an object of type B, the principle of induction tells us to cease believing in the association between objects of type A and type B, fitting the present reality. Thus there is no way to obtain a verifiably false conclusion using the principle of induction. However, because all of our knowledge of the future, or the unknown, seems to rest on this principle, it is very difficult to deny. The existence and applicability of such beliefs are the most difficult and debated topics in philosophy, which we will continue to discuss in the next chapter.

Question: How do we quantify this via Bayesian probability, and justify this?









### Chapter 7: On Our Knowledge of General Principles

Everyone believes the principle of induction, despite the fact that it is not possible to verify it in experience. Here we consider other principles with this property. If our theory of knowledge is to best understood, we must critically examing these principles:

- Modus Ponens (Deducing that the truth of a statement 'A implies B' and the truth of the statement 'A' must mean the statement 'B' is true) is used in all theoretical arguments. Without the principle, an argument (in the greek sense) itself would be meaningless, since it would not be necessary to accept the conclusion of the argument if the premises were true.

- The law of identity: 'A implies A'.

- The law of contradiction: 'Nothing can be both true and false'.

- The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must be either true or false'.

A classical argument in philosophy is that between the *empiricists* (e.g. such as the British philosophers Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), who believed all knowledge derives from experience, and the *rationalists* (e.g. Descartes and Leibnitz) who believed that in addition to experiential knowledge, we also had certain innate knowledge. We have already argued that some principles we definitely believe (like induction, or the existence of physical matter) cannot be derived from experience, which favors the rationalist side.  On the other hand, it is only experience that causes us to direct our attention to these general laws, even those this experience cannot possibly give us knowledge of these laws. Knowledge which cannot be proved by experience we call *a priori knowledge*.

Russell believes that we cannot possibly deduce the knowledge of the existence of something without some foundation in experiential knowledge. Rationalists believed this could be done, e.g. Descartes' purely rational argument for the existence of god. A priori knowledge can only deduce the connections between the existence of things (e.g. the existence of a baby implies the existence of a mother).

Question: How do we know this is true?

Another kind of a priori judgements are judgements of desirability / judgements of an ethical nature. Knowledge as to how useful something is can sometimes be obtained from experience, but it can often be useful because it is desirable. These desires may be induced by our experience, but their existence cannot be justified by experience. This is discussed in detail in ethics, where the distinction from *what is* (empirical judgements) are separated from *what ought to be* (normative judgements).

Mathematics is a priori. Some empiricists percieve it not to be, i.e. we learn that two and two make four by observing examples of where two and two make four. But this is clearly not how we actually do justify this to ourselves. But there are several reasons why this is not necessarily a great argument:

- After enough experience, our brain percieves two things as representatives of the abstract quantity of two, and we then utilize the general principle that two and two are four. Thus any instance of this principle becomes typical. We do not continue empirically observing that two and two are four after that, increasing our belief in that property more and more as we keep observing the situation. Our certainty is so great that we cannot possibly increase it further. Thus we have a certain belief rather than an inductive belief.

- We also believe that this proposition would be true 'in all possible worlds'.

This differs from a statement such as 'All men are mortal', where we believe this statement because we have no experience of a person older than 150 years, and there are certain physiological principles which argue that a person's body should eventually decay. In another world, we can imagine an immortal man, e.g. in fiction. This is a statement which we verify empirically, vs. a priori.

It is often better to proceed to the truth of judgements via inductive methods than via deductive methods. For instance, the classic proof that "Socrates is mortal" can be deduced from the statement that "All men are mortal". But we only know all men are mortal through inductive knowledge, and thus only to some degree of certainty, and the statement "Socrates is mortal" can be verified by induction, and is a weaker statement than the statement that all men are mortal. Thus we should verify Socrates is mortal inductively rather than verify All men are mortal inductively first, and then deduce that Socrates is mortal.

Question: Is Newtonian Physics also of this nature?

Question: Is it really better to inductively determine that Socrates is mortal? How would one inductively verify this?











### Chapter 8: A Priori Knowledge is Possible

Immanuel Kant is generally regarded as one of the greatest modern philosophers. His most unique contribution to philosophy was the 'critical method', which, under the assumption that we know certain knowledge, deduces other a priori metaphysical knowledge that is necessary to obtain that knowledge. One might doubt some applications of this method, but one cannot doubt some of Kant's more concrete claims: that some a priori synthetic knowldege is possible. The method also shows how important the theory of knowledge is to general philosophy.

Before Kant, most people believed the only a priori knowledge was analytic. For instance, Hume came up with a legitimate argument that the law of cause and effect was not analytic, e.g. that an effect could not be logically deduced from a cause. He was therefore led to believe that the law of cause and effect could not be a priori knowledge. This bothered Kant, who was educated in the rationalist tradition.

Certainly, there exist synthetic a priori beliefs. For instance, Kant famously argued that 7 + 5 = 12 is not an analytic statement, because 7 and 5 must be put together to make 12. There is nothing in the concept of 12 that tells us that it is made up of 7 and 5.

Question: Do You Believe This?

Another objection to the empiricists is that experience is particular, whereas much of the knowledge we deal with is general. As we discussed with induction, it seems very strange that we could know something about things which we have no experience of, e.g. we do not know the people living in London in 200 years, but we know if we put two of them together with another two they make four.

Kant's system distinguishes two elements to an analysis of metaphysics. The first, the 'thing in itself', is the physical object under consideration. The second object, the 'phenomenon' is a product of human nature, reacting to the sense data we percieve of the thing in itself. One interesting point Kant makes is that the act of percieving time and space, and of making relations with our sensations, come out of our a priori faculties. This is why we can justify that all phenomena we experience exist in time and space, because these are core faculties of our percieving of these objects in our mind.

A quirk of Kant's system is that, because we can only ever percieve and think about phenomena (sensations cause us to think about phenomena, not things in themselves), we can have no a priori knowledge of the outside world. We have no idea at all whether things in themselves exist in time and space, rather than us just percieving them to have these properties via the faculties of time and space we have a priori in our mind. Thus a priori propositions cannot be applied to any object in itself, only to phenomena. Kant thus severely limits the scope of his analysis.

Question: How can we have inductive knowledge of 'the thing in itself' if we only ever percieve a phenomena.

Russell identifies several problems with Kant's arguments. First, Kant's argument gives us no greater certainty of a priori knowledge. The fact that the principle that 'two and two make four' comes from ourselves and our mental faculties does not tell us anything about whether that principle may be justified in the future, since our mind may change in the future. One might argue that this argument does not hold in a Kantian sense, since in this system the mind exists outside of time, and only percieves phenomena in time via its mental faculties. But a Kantian will still have to acknowledge that the time related to an object is still related to the principles behind phenomena, and so the argument still stands in this sense.

We must also correct a common misconception among philosophers that a priori knowledge is related to 'what we can think'. It is a principle about the real world. Thus the law of contradiction does not state that 'the mind cannot percieve something as being true and being false' It is a belief that that something really is either true or false. When we say two and two make four, we are not asserting that the mind naturally believes that two and two make four. We are asserting that two and two really do make four. Kant believes that relations are the work of the mind, and do not exist in the physical world. But when we say "We are in our room", we are asserting a truth about the physical world, and not about a relation of things that exists in our mind. Thus objects like relations, and a priori truths, must exist in a world neither mental or physical. This is the world of universals.



### Chapter 9: The World of Universals

In the last chapter we justified reasons to believe in objects that are neither mental, nor physical, nor sense data. These are the *universals*. We begin by discussing what kinds of objects are universals, and then discuss their nature. This chapter will mainly be a discussion of Plato's interpretation of universals, i.e. what is called the theory of forms. Sometimes these objects are called ideas, but this is confusing, since these objects are not necessarily mental.

When we consider the concept of justice, we begin by considering various intentions / actions, and then determine whether they are just or not. The common nature of these objects compromises a pure object, known as justice, which particulars take on when they become just. A more concrete example would be the property of 'whiteness'. We have discussed that this property is not a property of physical objects, but of our sense data. But we are quick to say we see whiteness in an object. The property of justice and whiteness cannot be identified with a physical object, it is something that other objects partake in. It is also not mutable, existing independently of time and space. Thus the world of universals is quite different from other objects. We call non universal objects *particulars*.

QUESTION: Can justice be an opinion?

It is easy and natural for the theory of universals to take on a mystical character, e.g. stating that universals live in heaven. But this is not necessary, we can study universals purely based in logical thinking.

All judgements involve universals, since no statement can be made that does not involve a universal in some kind. The simplest example might be the phrase "I like this", but even the term "like" denotes a universal, which gives a relation of preference between objects. It therefore seems strange that universals seem so unnatural to our thinking.

This is because we are likely to focus on particulars in judgements. For instance, in evaluating the claim "Charles I's head was cut off", we naturally concentrate on an image of Charles I's head, i.e. a particular substantiating the universals of "head", "cut", and "possession". That this thought process is natural has been used by empiricists like Berkeley and Hume deny the existence of universals. When we think of the concept of 'whiteness', what we are really thinking of is a particular white object, and when reasoning about whiteness, we are therefore just reasoning about a particular white object, taking care not to assume things that are not true of other white objects. While this might be true of our mental processes, without the existence of universals, it becomes very difficult to ask how we *know* an object is white. One might argue by claiming an object is white if it resembles other white objects, but then one has reduced the problem to determining when we know when one object resembles another object. Thus *resemblence* is in this case a fundamental universal. And once we have acknowledge this universal, it becomes too laborious to try and eliminate other universals from existing.

Lots of metaphysics since Spinoza has neglected to acknowledge the existence of universals that give relations between two or more objects. The belief was that every proposition can be regarded as an attribute of a single object. Thus it was thought that relations cannot exist, which implies that there can only be a single object in the universe, or at least, a multitude of objects that cannot relate to one another in any way. The first of these views, advocated by Spinoza and still held by contemporary philosophers such as Bradley, and is known as *monism*. The second, advocated by Leibnitz, but not really very common these days, is called *monadism*, because each of the isolated objects is called a monad. In fact, as we have seen in the last paragraph, it is harder to prove the existence of *qualities*, i.e. universal properties, than it is to prove the existence of universal relations, like resemblence.

We must next argue that universals are not mental objects, i.e. that their properties are independent of thought. For instance, it seems unnatural to see the relation "north" in the statement "Edinburgh is north of London" as being purely mental. The truth or falsity of this judgement does not seem to be effected in any way by our mental processes. The statement would remain true even if all minds were to suddenly vanish from the world. Thus the concept of northness cannot be mental, since it is a constituent part of the facts. Thus we must apprehend the notion of northness, rather than create it in our minds. But the universal property of "northness" is not a physical object. It does not exist in a particular time or place. It does not exist in Edinburgh, nor in London. We shall therefore say that universal do not exist, they *subsist* or *have being*.

That universals are not physical objects is one of the main reasons why we percieve universals to be mental objects. We can certainly think of a universal, but the universal does not exist in our minds. If we are thinking of whiteness, it is not "whiteness" that is in our minds, but the "act of thinking about whiteness". We have returned to the problems in Berkeley's idealist argument.





### Chapter 10:	On Our Knowledge of Universals

Universals, like particulars, can be known by acquaintance or by description. We learn about whiteness by being acquainted with white things, and we eventually learn to abstract the concept of whiteness. We might call a universal which we can learn about in this manner a *sensible quality*. Similarily, I hear three chimes, and I am acquainted with the universal quality of being before or after something.

We shall now argue that all a priori knowledge deals with universals. The statement "two and two make four" is a priori, but involves only the universals "two" and "four", and no particular things. Indeed, if we know things by description, our a priori reasoning about these objects is really in terms of the descriptive claims we make about these objects, i.e. the universal properties these objects satisfy.

What seems strange about such statements is that they seem to control experience, i.e. they tell us that if you put a pair of people together in a room with another pair of people, then that room contains four people. But no fact independent of experience can tell us anything about experience. While we may know a priori that two and two make four, we do not know a priori that Brown and Jones make two, or that Robinson and Smith make two, so we cannot conclude a priori that Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith make four. 

Question: I don't know if I agree.

An empirical claim is justified by the evidence. A universal claim can be applied by empirically verifying that some objects are described by certain universal claims.

It might seem that a priori claims give us knowledge about objects we have never percieved. For instance, we believe the statement "the product of two integers, each never concieved by any human, is bigger than 100", but we can never give a particular instance to empirically verify this claim in practice. Thus one might be lead to deny the truth of such claims. But such claims are vital to what is known about the world: we are never acquainted directly with physical objects, but we use knowledge claims about them via knowledge by description.

Let us now summarize what we have learned about knowledge:

- We must distinguish between knowledge of object, and knowledge of truths.

- We can know objects via acquaintance, or via description (and thus via knowledge of truths).

- We have immediate, or intuitive knowledge, of some truths, sometimes called 'self evident', as well a sdeductive knowledge obtained from reasoning about this intuitive knowledge.

We now move on to a deeper analysis of the scope of intuitive knowledge, in much the same way we analyzed the scope of knowledge by acquaintance. One problem not present with acquaintance is the possiblity of error. Many intuitive truth claims turn out to be incorrect.






### Chapter 11: On Intuitive Knowledge

It is a common belief that it is only rational to belief things that are justified by an argument. Almost all of our beliefs are of this form. But all arguments rest on assumptions, and if we continue following the justification of assumptions, it seems we must eventually be lead to consider principles that cannot be argued to be true. For instance, we have found the principle of induction, or modus ponens, to be such a principle.

Other principles also seem self evident, even if we can prove them from other assumptions. For instance, the rules of logical are not independent from one another, and despite the fact that we can prove 2 + 2 = 4 from the Peano axioms, it also seems self evident. More controversially, some ethical principles also seem self evident, e.g. "we should do what is good".

Particular cases of a general principle are more self evident than that principle itself. For instance "a rose cannot be both red and not red" is more self evident than the principle of contradiction itself. This seems to be the case because we build up the mental faculty of recognizing a general property as self evident from viewing many particulars of that general property.

QUESTION: Do you feel this is the case? I feel like I recognize the principle of contradiction before I recognize

Another way we obtain self evident truths are judgements of memory. We first note that when we remember something, the image that we see in our consciousness is not the memory itself, because the image is in the present, and the object we remember is in the past. Memory must therefore constitute a process of self evident truth where we identify an image in our mind as having been caused by some past experience.  Without this self evident judgement of an image as coming from a memory, we would never even be able to think about the past at all. Our ability to remember what caused an image to pop into our minds degrades over time though, so that the trustworthyness of our judgements of the cause of a memory degrade over time. In some cases this might be because the memory was itself true, but caused by something else, e.g. George IV was said to have believed he was at the battle of Waterloo because so many people used to say it to him. He was remembering the memory of people telling him rather than the experience of the battle itself.

QUESTION: What would it mean to misjudge something as a memory?

Judgements are not both self-evident and non self-evident. It seems there is a gradation of things, e.g. being more self evident than other things. If we identify two contradictory self-evident facts, we will discount the one that is less self-evident. Self-evidence is important in the theory of knowledge precisely because it can be fallible, or else self-evidence would correspond exactly with the truth of things, and we would not need to distinguish between the concepts. We will return to the correspondence with self-evidence and truth in two Chapters, after we discuss the concept of truth itself.









### Chapter 12: Truth and Falsehood

There is a dualism between truth and falsity when it comes to judgements. This is not the case with acquaintance. Whatever we are acquainted with, we are acquainted with. It is not possible to be misacquainted with something, though it is possible to draw incorrect conclusions from an acquaintance. It is possible for a belief to be either truth or false. In order to further discuss how to determine when something self evident is true or false, we must first discuss what it actually means for something to be true or false.

We note that any theory of truth *must* account for a theory of false statements, which is what makes an analysis of truth different from an analysis of acquaintance. Truth must also depend on something independent of a belief itself; no matter how self evident a belief is, it can still be false. Thus we are lead to the *correspondence* theory of truth: a belief is true if it corresponds to a 'fact'. This is partly a reason why thoughts can never truly know when something is true or not, since truth corresponds to something outside of the mental faculty.

Some philosophers believe in a *coherence* theory of truth. A judgement is true if it is compatible with all other judgements. But this means that truth is not universal: there can certainly exist two different compatible families of judgements. Another problem with the theory is an implicit circularity. To discard truths that are incoherent, we must already believe in the truth of the principle of contradiction. Thus we could never judge the truth of the principle of contradiction itself via the coherence theory of truth.

It cannot be true that a belief is a relation between a person and an object: 'the judgement is believed'. This would mean that one would have to account in the theory for objects that are not so. For instance, if I were to believe, incorrectly, that "Desmond loves Cassio", then my belief would be a relation between myself and "Desmond's love for Cassio", which means that "Desmond's love for Cassio" would have to exist in itself. In fact, in order to account for falsehood, relation must therefore have to involve more than just a person, and a judgement. 

Let us now precisely define truth. A mind, or *subject* makes a judgement, and that judgement involves certain *terms*, also called *objects*. The relations, put together with the objects, either make up a complex whole that exists, or they do not make up a complex whole. And it is this existence which is what we call truth. False statements involve terms that do not 'fit together' to make a complex whole in reality. That complex whole is a *fact*. Thus we conclude that a judgement is true when it corresponds to a fact.

NOTE: The theory of forms is really doing a lot of legwork here.

Question: How does this get around the above problem. What if Desmond doesn't exist? Or Cassio? I Guess the underlying objects in everything we formulate must be apperceptions, so that the statmenet "Desmond's love for Cassio" really involves all apperceptions that made us believe Desmond and Cassio and love exist, and that there are additional assumptions that these apperceptions themselves make up a complex whole in that they are relation to the concepts of Desmond, of Cassio, and of the love relation.





### Chapter 13: Knowledge, Error, and Probable Opinion

Now we have defined truth and falsity, the ultimate question of epistemology arises. How can we know when a belief is *knowledge*? Of course, this requires us to analyze what we mean by knowledge.

We might say that knowledge is a true belief, but this does not agree with how the word knowledge is used in everyday language. For instance, if someone flips a coin to predict the results of a football match happening next week, we do not believe that person has knowledge of the results of a football match, even if the prediction turns out to be correct. Similarily, if we deduce a statement from fallacious reasoning, we would not call that statement knowledge, even if that statement itself was true.

We might also say that knowledge is a statement derived from correct logical principles, from assumptions that are true. But the assumptions should be *known*, not just true, or we return to the problems from the previous paragraph, and then our definition becomes circular, since one must know the assumptions in the first place. One way to fix this might be to distinguish between *derivative* knowledge and *intuitive* knowledge. This is mostly agreeable, but it means we must now also understand what is meant by intuitive knowledge.

Before we do that, we must notice and remedy one objection to the derivative knowledge given above. Often we obtain knowledge of something by deriving something from intuitive knowledge that could be obtained deductively. If we read that "The King is Dead", we believe intuitively that the king is dead, without every consciously going through the deductive argument that our sense data we obtained by looking at the characters that compose the english language was obtained from news print announcing the kings death. We might call this *psychological inference*. Thus we must accept some intuitive knowledge as derivative, provided there *is* a deductive argument from other intuitive knowledge, and a person, upon reflective, could find this deductive argument.

Note: Does this resolve the Tortoise and Achilles paradox?

We obtained a theory of deductive knowledge by recourse into intuitive knowledge, but intuitive knowledge does not have any backup in this regard. We begin by acknowledging that the *absolutely self-evident knowledge* we can obtain are those obtained by direct acquaintance with the fact. The statement "Desmond Loves Cassio" can only be absolutely self evident to Desmond, since he is the only one with acquaintance with the mental object "Desmond's love for Cassio". Since we can only be directly acquainted with mental data, e.g. sense data or thoughts, a fact can only be completely self evident to a single individual. 

Question: Don't understand second last paragraph of page 98

Question: How do we have direct acquaintance with a fact if a fact is a universal?

Question: If something is absolutely self evident, can it ever not be absolutely self evident?

Thus knowledge is something intuitively absolutely evident, or reasoned out from such knowledge using logical principles. Something that is believed hesitatingly, because it is derived using logical principles from less self evident beliefs, we shall call *probable knowledge*. Most of what we call 'knowledge' is actually probable knowledge.

Question: Are logical principles knowledge?

The coherence theory we discarded earlier becomes very useful in understanding probable knowledge, since probably knowledge that coheres with other probable knowledge becomes more self evident, and thus becomes more probable. The fact that dreams do not cohere with one another means we are less likely to believe in the reality in those dreams. But we note that probably knowledge can never become knowledge. But it is possbile for underlying judgements composing knowledge to become known absolutely through a process separately from which they are known probably.

NOTE: The test of coherence assumes that the principle of contradiction is absolutely self evident.

 But we could have obtained this deductively, by first reasoning that the sense data we recieve was obtained from 


But this causes problems because it requires us to know when assumptions are true.
