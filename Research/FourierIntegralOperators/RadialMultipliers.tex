\chapter{Notation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We use the normalization of the Fourier transform
    %
    \[ \widehat{f}(\xi) = \int f(x) e^{- 2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; dx \]
    %
    which is standard in classical analysis.

    \item We let $\text{Dil}_t$ be the dilation operator on functions, i.e. the operator such that
    %
    \[ \text{Dil}_t f(x) \coloneqq f(x/t). \]
    %
    Overloading notation, we consider dyadic dilations
    %
    \[ \text{Dil}_j f(x) \coloneqq f(x/2^j). \]
    %
    There is no confusion here since the dyadic dilation operator will only be used along with symbols that stand for integers, like $n$, $m$, $j$, or $k$, whereas the other dilation operator will be used in all other cases, so which dilation we use should be clear from the context.

    \item We use $\partial_j$ to denote the usual partial derivative operators, and $D_j$ to denote the self-adjoint normalization $D_j f \coloneqq (2 \pi i)^{-1} \partial_j$. This notation has the convenience that for a polynomial $P$,
    %
    \[ P(D_j) \{ f \} = \int P(\xi) \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi, \]
    %
    which simplifies some of the studies of pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators.

    \item We will often use the Japanese bracket $\langle x \rangle \coloneqq (1 + |x|^2)^{1/2}$ for $x \in \RR^d$.

    \item For integers $n$ and $m$, we let $\llbracket n,m \rrbracket \coloneqq \{ n, n+1, \dots, m \}$.
\end{itemize}

%It will often be helpful to consider a family of bump functions for the purposes of localization.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item We begin with a non-negative function $\beta \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ such that:
    % How do we construct beta?
    % We take some bump function phi equal to one on |x| <= a and supported on |x| <= b,
    % and then define beta(x) = phi(x) - phi(2x)
    % Then beta is supported on a/2 <= |x| <= b, and equal to one when b/2 <= |x| <= a
    % We must therefore have a >= b/2 to have a region where the function is equal to one
    % the size of this region is then (a - b/2)
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item $\text{supp}(\beta) \subset \{ 0.625 \leq |x| \leq 1.5 \}$.

%        \item $\beta(x) = 1$ for $0.75 \leq |x| \leq 1.25$.

%        \item For any $x \neq 0$, $\sum_{j \in \ZZ} \text{Dil}_j \beta(x) = 1$.
%    \end{itemize}
    
%    \item Next, we let $\alpha = \sum_{j < 0} \text{Dil}_j \beta$. Then $\alpha \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$, and:
    %
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item $\text{supp}(\alpha) \subset \{ |x| \leq 1 \}$.

%        \item $\alpha(x) = 1$ for $|x| \leq 0.625$.

%        \item For any $x \neq 0$, $\alpha(x) + \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \text{Dil}_j \beta(x) = 1$.
%    \end{itemize}

%    \item We also consider a function $\tilde{\beta} \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ such that:
    %
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item $\text{supp}(\tilde{\beta}) \subset \{ 0.5 \leq |x| \leq 2 \}$
%        \item $\tilde{\beta}(x) = 1$ for $0.625 \leq |x| \leq 1.5$.
%        \item For any $x \neq 0$, $\sum_{j \in \ZZ} \text{Dil}_j \tilde{\beta}(x) = 1$.
%    \end{itemize}
    %
%    The second property implies that for any function $f$ with $\text{supp}(f) \subset \{ 0.5 \leq |x| \leq 2 \}$, we have $f \tilde{\beta} = f$. In particular, this implies that $\beta \tilde{\beta} = \beta$.

\part{Background}

\chapter{Fourier Multipliers}

The question of the regularity of translation-invariant operators on $\RR^d$ has proved central to the development of modern harmonic analysis and the theory of linear partial differential operators. This is because for essentially any translation invariant operator $T$, we can find a tempered distribution $m: \RR^d \to \CC$, the \emph{symbol} of $T$, such that for any Schwartz function $f \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$,
%
\[ Tf(x) = \int_{\RR^d} m(\xi) \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi. \]
%
In other words, we find that
%
\[ \widehat{Tf}(\xi) = m(\xi) \widehat{f}(\xi), \]
%
which is why such operators are also called \emph{Fourier multipliers}. Applying the notation of spectral calculus, one might also write this operator as $m(D)$, where $D = (2 \pi i)^{-1} \nabla$ is a self-adjoint normalization of the gradient operator. Thus the study of the boundedness of translation invariant operators is closely connected to the study of the interactions of the operators
%
\[ E_\xi f(x) \coloneqq \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}, \]
%
which act as projections onto the common eigenspaces of the components of $D$, since we can write $m(D)$ as a vector-valued integral of the form
%
\[ m(D) = \int_{\RR^d} m(\xi) E_\xi\; d\xi. \]
%
Thus $m(D)$ is represented as a weighted average of the operators $\{ E_\xi \}$.

The study of translation invariant operators emerges from classical questions in analysis, like those related to the convergence of Fourier series, or problems in mathematical physics via the study of the heat, wave, and Schr\"{o}dinger equation. These physical equations also often have \emph{rotational} symmetry, so it is natural to restrict our attention to translation-invariant operators which are also rotation-invariant. Such operators are precisely those operators associated with \emph{radial} symbols $m: \RR^d \to \CC$, i.e. symbols for which there exists a function $h: [0,\infty) \to \RR$ such that
%
\[ m(\xi) = h( |\xi|) \]
%
for some function $h: [0,\infty) \to \CC$. This is the class of \emph{radial Fourier multipliers}. The notation of spectral calculus leads us to write
%
\[ m(D) = h \left( \sqrt{-\Delta} \right), \]
%
where $\Delta = \sum D_i^2 = (2\pi)^{-2} \sum \partial_i^2$ is the Laplacian on $\RR^d$. Thus the study of radial multipliers is closely connected to interactions between the spherical restriction operators
%
\[ E_\lambda f(x) \coloneqq \int_{|\xi| = \lambda} \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi, \]
%
for $0 < \lambda < \infty$, which are the projections onto the eigenspaces of $\Delta$. Similar to the study of $m(D)$, we then have
%
\[ h \left( \sqrt{-\Delta} \right) = \int_0^\infty h(\lambda) E_\lambda\; d\lambda. \]
%
Thus studying the regularity of radial Fourier multipliers allows us to understand the interactions between the operators $\{ E_\lambda \}$.

Suggested by the discussion above, the theory of radial multipliers can be extended from $\RR^d$ to the much more general setting of Riemannian manifolds. On any such manifold $X$, we can define a Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ as an unbounded operator on $L^2(X)$, and provided $X$ is geodesically complete, this operator will be essentially self-adjoint. Thus we can consider a spectral calculus. In particular, we can study the unbounded operators $h(\sqrt{-\Delta})$ on $L^2(X)$, for bounded, Borel measurable functions $h: [0,\infty) \to \CC$. The study of such operators should tell us how different eigenfunctions of $\Delta$ interact with one another. Some techniques of analyzing radial multipliers on $\RR^d$ extend to the Riemannian case. In other cases, new tools are required.

The main focus of this research project is the study of necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee the $L^p$ boundedness of radial multiplier operators, both in the Euclidean setting, and also in the setting of Riemannian manifolds. % stimulated by recent developments which indicate lines of attack for three related problems in the field.


\section{Convolution Kernels of Fourier Multipliers}

It is often useful to study spatial representations of these operators, since one can often exploit certain geometry to obtain useful results. Given any translation invariant operator $T$, we can associate a tempered distribution $k: \RR^d \to \CC$, the \emph{convolution kernel} of $T$, such that for any Schwartz function $f \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$,
%
\[ Tf(y) = \int_{\RR^d} k(x) f(y-x)\; dx, \]
%
If $T$ is radial, we can write $k(x) = a(|x|)$ for some function $a: [0,\infty) \to \CC$, and then we have a representation
%
\[ T = \int_0^\infty a(r) S_r\; dr, \]
%
where
%
\[ S_rf(x) \coloneqq \int_{|y| = r} f(x + y)\; dy, \]
%
are the \emph{spherical averaging operators}. Thus problems about radial translation-invariant operators are also connected to spherical averaging problems.

With the notation as above, the function $k$ is the \emph{Fourier transform} of $m$, and the function $a$ is a \emph{Bessel transform} of $h$, i.e. $a = \mathcal{B}_d h$, where
%
\[ \mathcal{B}_d h(r) \coloneqq (2 \pi) r^{1-d/2} \int_0^\infty h(\lambda) J_{d/2 - 1}(2 \pi \lambda r) \lambda^{d/2}\; d\lambda. \]
%
Here $J_{d/2-1}$ is the Bessel function of order $d/2 - 1$, given by the formula
%
\[ J_\alpha(\lambda) \coloneqq \frac{(\lambda / 2)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha + 1/2)} \int_{-1}^1 e^{i \lambda s} (1 - s^2)^{\alpha - 1/2}\; ds. \]
%
For later reference, we note that, using the theory of stationary phase, for each $d$, we can find symbols $s_1$ and $s_2$ of order $-1/2$ such that
%
\[ J_d(\lambda) = e^{2 \pi i (\lambda - \omega)} s_1(\lambda) + e^{-2 \pi i (\lambda - \omega)} s_2(\lambda), \]
%
which makes it easier to understand the function for large values of $\lambda$.

\section{Multipliers on Euclidean Space}

The general study of the boundedness properties of Fourier multipliers in multiple variables was initiated in the 1950s, as connections of the theory to partial differential equations became more fully realized\footnote{See \cite{Hormander1} for a discussion of what was discovered at this time, and for a more detailed exposition of the content of this section.}. It was quickly realized that the most fundamental estimates were $L^p$ bounds of the form
%
\[ \| Tf \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
%for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, and $q \geq p$, which by duality are equivalent to bounds
%
%\[ \| Tf \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{q^*}(\RR^d)}, \]
%
It is therefore natural to introduce the spaces $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$, consisting of all symbols $m$ which induce a Fourier multiplier operator $T$ bounded from $L^p(\RR^d)$ to $L^q(\RR^d)$. The space $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ is then a Banach space under the operator norm
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \coloneqq \sup \left\{ \frac{\| T f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}}{\| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}} : f \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d) \right\}. \]
%
For notational convenience, $M^{p,p}(\RR^d)$ is denoted by $M^p(\RR^d)$. Duality implies that $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ is isometric to $M^{q^* \negmedspace ,p^*}(\RR^d)$, where $p^*$ and $q^*$ are the conjugates to $p$ and $q$. And the fact these operators are translation invariant, together with Littlewood's Principle, implies that $M^{p,q}(\RR^d) = \{ 0 \}$, unless $q \geq p$. Combining these reductions, we see that it suffices to study the spaces $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ where $1 \leq p \leq 2$ and where $q \geq p$, or alternatively, the spaces $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$, where $2 \leq p \leq \infty$ and $q \geq p$.

The spaces $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ are difficult to characterize in general, but do have ismple characterizations for very particular parameters of $p$ and $q$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The spaces $M^{1,q}(\RR^d) = M^{q^*,\infty}(\RR^d)$ are easily characterized by virtue of the fact that the study of the boundedness of operators with domain $L^1(\RR^d)$, or range $L^\infty(\RR^d)$ is often trivial; we have
    %
    \[ M^{1,q}(\RR^d) = \widehat{L^q(\RR^d)} \quad\text{for $q > 1$,}\quad \text{and}\quad M^{1,1}(\RR^d) = \widehat{M(\RR^d)}, \]
    %
    Here $M(\RR^d)$ is the space of all finite signed Borel measures, equipped with the total variation norm. Stated more quantitatively, this equality asserts that for any symbol $m$, if $k = \widehat{m}$ is the associated convolution kernel, then
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^{1,q}(\RR^d)} = \| k \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}\quad\text{for $q > 1$,}\quad \text{and}\quad \| m \|_{M^{1,1}(\RR^d)} = \| k \|_{M(\RR^d)}. \]
    %
    The proof follows from Schur's Lemma, which often gives tight estimates when obtaining bounds with domain $L^1(\RR^d)$.

    \item The unitary nature of the Fourier transform implies $M^2(\RR^d) = L^\infty(\RR^d)$, i.e. for any symbol $m$,
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^2(\RR^d)} = \| m \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}. \]
    %
    The proof follows from Parseval's identity.
    %
    % | m f^ |_{L^2} <= | m |_q | f |_p
    % If f^ is an extremizer for m
    % where $q = 2p/(2-p)$ for $1 \leq p < 2$, and $q = \infty$ for $p = 2$.
\end{itemize}
%
It is surprising that these are the \emph{only} currently known necessary and sufficient characterizations of the spaces $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$. No simple characterizations of these spaces are known for any other values of $p$ and $q$, and perhaps no simple characterizations exist. Nonetheless, several tools for analyzing Fourier multipliers in this range have been developed, and we end this section by briefly summarizing some relevant results.

We begin with the major tool of \emph{Littlewood-Paley} theory, which makes it natural to restrict to the study of Fourier multipliers compactly suported on dyadic annuli.
\begin{comment}
    We can therefore introduce the Littlewood-Paley projection operators $P_j$, which are Fourier multipliers with symbol $\text{Dil}_{2^j} \phi$. Littlewood-Paley theory guarantees that for $1 < r < \infty$,
%
\[ \| f \|_{L^r(\RR^d)} \sim_r \left( \sum_n \| P_n f \|_{L^r(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2}. \]
%
We also must introduce a slightly thickened function $\tilde{\phi} \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ supported on $\{ \xi \in \RR^d: 1/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 4 \}$, equal to one on the support of $\phi$, and with $1 = \sum_j \text{Dil}_{2^j} \tilde{\phi}$, then we can introuce the Littlewood-Paley projections $\tilde{P}_j$ with symbol $\text{Dil}_{2^j} \tilde{\phi}$. For $1 < q < \infty$, we thus have
%
\[ \| m(D) f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \sim_q \left( \sum_j \| P_j m(D) f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2} = \left( \| P_j m(D) \{ \tilde{P}_j f \} \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2}. \]
%
Now
%
\[ P_j m(D) \{ \tilde{P}_j f \} = \text{Dil}_{1/2^j} \{ m_{2^j}(D) \circ \text{Dil}_{2^j} \{ \tilde{P}_j f \} \}, \]
%
and so
%
\[ \| P_j m(D) \{ \tilde{P}_j f \} \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} = 2^{-jd/q} \| m_{2^j}(D) \text{Dil}_{2^j} \{ \tilde{P}_j f \} \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}. \]
%
We thus have
%
\begin{align*}
    \| m(D) f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} &\lesssim_q \left( \sum_j 4^{jd(1/p - 1/q)} \| m_{2^j} \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}^2 \| \tilde{P}_j f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2}\\
    &\leq \left( \sup_t t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \| m_t \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \right) \left( \sum_j \| \tilde{P}_j f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2}\\
    &\sim_p \left( \sup_t t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \| m_t \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \right) \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}.
\end{align*}
%
Moreover, this inequality is tight.
\end{comment}
Fix a smooth function $\beta \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ compactly supported away from the origin on a neighborhood of the unit annulus, such that for $x \neq 0$,
%
\[ \sum_{j \in \ZZ} (\text{Dil}_j \beta)(x) = 1. \]
%
For a symbol $m$, for $t > 0$, and an integer $j$, we define
%
\[ m_t \coloneqq (\text{Dil}_{1/t} m) \cdot \beta \quad\text{and}\quad m_j \coloneqq (\text{Dil}_{1/2^j} m) \cdot \beta. \]
%
Then $m_t$ describes the behaviour of the multiplier $m$ restricted to the annulus of frequencies $|\xi| \sim t$, but rescaled so that this behaviour is now lying on the annulus $|\xi| \sim 1$. Similarily, $m_j$ describes the rescaled behaviour of $m$ on the annulus of frequencies $|\xi| \sim 2^j$, appropriately rescaled. We have
%
\[ m(D) = \sum\nolimits_j m_j(D / 2^j). \]
%
Littlewood-Paley theory tells us that if we define $P_j$ to be the Fourier multiplier with symbol $\text{Dil}_j \beta$, then for any $g: \RR^d \to \CC$, and any $1 < p < \infty$,
%
\[ \| g \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \sim_p \left\| \left( \sum_{j \in \ZZ} |P_j g|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
If we introduce a function $\tilde{\beta}$, which is smooth, compactly supported, with the same properties as $\beta$, but equal to one on the support of $\beta$, and we introduce the analogous projection operators $\tilde{P}_j$, then we find that
%
\[ [P_j \circ m(D)] \{ f \} = [m_j(D / 2^j)] \{ f \} = [m_j(D/2^j)] \{ \tilde{P}_j f \}. \]
%
A similar Littlewood-Paley inequality holds for the projections $\{ \tilde{P_j} \}$, and so we conclude that, for an input function $f: \RR^d \to \CC$, if we set $f_j = \tilde{P}_j f$, then to show $m \in M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ for $1 < p,q < \infty$, the Littlewood-Paley inequalities for $\{ P_j \}$ and $\{ \tilde{P}_j \}$ imply that a vector-valued inequality of the form
%
\begin{equation} \label{LittlewoodPaley}
    \left\| \left( \sum\nolimits_j |m_j(D/2^j) f_j|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left\| \left( \sum\nolimits_j |f_j|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}
\end{equation}
%
is equivalent to the bound $\| m(D) f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$, i.e. equivalent to the inequality
%
\begin{equation} \label{LittlewoodTriangle}
    \left\| \sum m_j(D/2^j) f_j \right\|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| \sum f_j \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}.
\end{equation}
%
The advantage of using \eqref{LittlewoodPaley} over \eqref{LittlewoodTriangle} is that the $l^2$ sum gives a square root cancellation which makes it easier to combine bounds on the multipliers $m_j(D/2^j)$ for separate $j$. It is therefore natural to \emph{first} restrict the analysis of multipliers to the individual multipliers $m_j(D/2^j)$, which have the perk that they are compactly supported in frequency space on dyadic annuli, and so their Fourier transforms are all smooth. The rescaling symmetries of $\RR^d$ imply that we can actually restrict our analysis to the study to the multipliers $m_j(D)$, which are supported on the annulus $\{ 1/2 \leq |\xi| \leq 2 \}$. In the sequel, we call multipliers supported on this annulus \emph{unit scale multipliers}. Once bounds for compactly supported multipliers are obtained, one can then rely on various techniques, such as the technology of Hardy spaces, together with the square root cancellation obtained by Littlewood-Paley theory, to show that in the expansion
%
\[ m(D) f = \sum_j m_j(D/2^j) f, \]
%
the terms on the right hand side do not interact significantly with one another, and so the estimates obtained for unit scale multipliers generalize to a more general family of multipliers. We will therefore find that most conditions guaranteering the boundedness of Fourier multiplier operators are given in terms of individual control on each of the symbols $\{ m_j \}$, since these individual controls will be sufficient to guarantee these symbols do not interact with one another.

Let us state some sufficient conditions currently known which allow one to determine whether a multiplier is bounded:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Young's convolution inequality, a very crude bound, not taking into account any oscillation in the convolution kernel, implies that if $p < q$ and
    %
    \[ 1/p - 1/q = 1 - 1/r, \]
    %
    then
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \leq \| k \|_{L^r(\RR^d)}, \]
    %
    and if $p = q$, then
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \leq \| k \|_{M^1(\RR^d)}. \]
%
%The H\"{o}rmander-Mikhlin theorem is a more sophisticated result which does take into account some of this oscillation. It states that if $1 < p < \infty$, and $\varepsilon > 0$, if $m$ is a unit scale multiplier lying in $L^\infty(\RR^d)$, and if $k$ is it's convolution kernel, then
% 
%\[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_{p,\varepsilon} \int |k(x)| \langle x \rangle^\varepsilon\; dx. \]
%
%In light of the bound
%
%\[ \int k(x) \langle x \rangle^\varepsilon\; dx \leq \| k(x) \langle x \rangle^{d/2 + 2 \varepsilon} \|_{L^2_x} \| \langle x \rangle^{-d/2 - \varepsilon} \|_{L^2_x} \lesssim \| k(x) \langle x \rangle^{d/2 + 2 \varepsilon} \|_{L^2_x}, \]
%
%we obtain a slightly weaker, but easier to use, inequality of the form
%
%\[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_\varepsilon \| m \|_{L^2_{d/2 + \varepsilon}}. \]

    \item The \emph{H\"{o}rmander-Mikhlin multiplier theorem} states that for $1 < p < \infty$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, if we let $k_t$ be the convolution kernel corresponding to the unit scale multiplier $m_t(D)$, then
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_{p,\varepsilon} \sup_{t > 0} \int |k_t(x)| \langle x \rangle^\varepsilon\; dx. \]
    %
    In particular, we have
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_{p,d} \sup_{0 \leq k \leq d/2 + 1} \sup_{\xi \in \RR^d} |\xi|^k |\nabla^k m(\xi)|. \]
    %
    Notice that the assumption of the H\"{o}rmander-Mikhlin multiplier theorem is an assumption on each of the multipliers $\{ m_t \}$ separately.

    \item The \emph{Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem} states that for $1 < p < \infty$, if $m \in L^\infty(\RR^d)$, and for any integer $0 < l \leq d$, and any subset $\alpha \subset \llbracket 1,d \rrbracket$, if we let
    %
    \[ \Xi_\alpha = \{ \xi \in \RR^d: \xi_i \neq 0\ \text{for all $i \in \alpha^c$} \}, \]
    %
    and for $k \subset \ZZ^d$, let $R_{\alpha,k}(\xi)$ denote the $|\alpha|$ dimensional set
    %
    \[ \{ \xi + \eta: 2^{k_i-1} \leq |\eta_i| \leq 2^{k_i}\ \text{for all $i \in \alpha$}\ \text{and}\ \eta_i = 0\ \text{for all $i \not \in \alpha$} \}. \]
    %
    Then for $1 < p < \infty$,
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_{p,d} \| m \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} + \sup_{\alpha \subset \llbracket 1,d \rrbracket} \sup_{\xi \in \Xi_\alpha} \sup_{k \in \ZZ^l} \int_{R_{\alpha,k}(\xi)} |\partial^\alpha m|. \]
    %
    In particular, we have
    %
    \[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_{p,d} \sup_{\alpha \subset \llbracket 1,d \rrbracket} \sup_{\xi \in \RR} |\partial^\alpha m(\xi)| |\xi_1|^{\alpha_1} \cdots |\xi_d|^{\alpha_d}. \]
\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Sufficient conditions have also been obtained on the side of the Fourier multiplier:
    %
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item An extension of the Hausdorff-Young inequality, due to Paley, tells us that for $1 < p \leq 2 \leq q < \infty$, with $1/p - 1/q = 1/r$, then
        %
%        \[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| m \|_{L^{r,\infty}(\RR^d)}. \]
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    \item One common heuristic to the theory is that the regularity of the symbol $m$, or equivalently, the decya of the convolution kernel $k$ away from the origin, implies some boundedness of the multiplier. There are several results of this form:
    %
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item A very crude bound 
%
%        \item A slightly more sophisticated bound is that if $p \leq 2 \leq q$ and $1/p - 1/q = 1/r$, then
        %
%        \[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| m \|_{L^{r,\infty}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
Conversely, we know some necessary conditions, that show some control over the mass and oscillatory properties of the multiplier $m$ is necessary in order to have $m \in M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ for some exponents $p$ and $q$. For instance,
%
\[ \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \| m_t \|_{L^{q^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \quad\text{for $1 \leq p \leq q \leq 2$}. \]
%
This implies, in particular, that $M^{p,q}(\RR^d) \subset L^{q^*}_{\text{loc}}(\RR^d - \{ 0 \})$, and in particular, any unit scale multiplier in $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ lies in $L^{q^*}(\RR^d)$. However, if $p < 2 < q$, there are unit scale multipliers in $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ which are distributions of positive order, i.e. that are not even measures. On the convolution kernel side, for any $p \leq q$, if $k_t$ is the convolution kernel of the multiplier $m_t(D)$, if $\phi \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ has Fourier transform equal to one on the annulus $1/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 4$, then
%
\[ \| k_t \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} = \| k_t * \phi \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} = \| m_t(D) \phi \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
Noting that $k_t = t^{-d} \text{Dil}_t \{ P_t k \}$, we can rewrite this inequality as saying that
%
\[ \| t^{d/q^*} P_t k \|_{L^\infty_t L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
Heuristically, the convolution kernel $k$ must have $d/q^*$ derivatives in $L^q$. More precisely, if we introduce the homogeneous Besov space $\dot{B}^s_{p,r}(\RR^d)$ to be the family of all distributions $f$ for which the Besov norm
%
%\[ \| f \|_{B^s_{p,r}(\RR^d)} \sim \| P_{\leq 0} f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} + \| 2^{sj} P_j f \|_{l^r_j \llbracket 0,\infty \rrparenthesis L^p(\RR^d)} \]
\[ \| f \|_{\dot{B}^s_{p,r}(\RR^d)} \sim \| 2^{sj} P_j f \|_{l^r(\ZZ) L^p(\RR^d)} \]
%
is finite, then the identity above says precisely that $k$ lies in $\dot{B}^{d/q^*}_{q,\infty}(\RR^d)$. If we also define the homogeneous spaces $\dot{A}^t_{p,r}(\RR^d)$ to be the space of all distributions for which
%
\[ \| f \|_{\dot{A}^t_{p,r}(\RR^d)} \sim \| 2^{sj} L_j m \|_{l^r(\ZZ) L^p(\RR^d)}, \]
%
where $L_j m = m \cdot \text{Dil}_j \phi$ are the spatial localizations to dyadic annuli, then the discussion in this paragraph entails that
%
\[ M^{p,q}(\RR^d) \subset \widehat{\dot{B}^{d/q^*}_{q,\infty}}(\RR^d) \cap \dot{A}^{-d/q}_{q^*,\infty}. \]
%
%\[ \| k \|_{B^{d/q^*}_{q,\infty}(\RR^d)} + \| m \|_{\dot{A}^{-d/q}_{q^*,\infty}} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \]
% m_t(xi) = m(t xi) beta(xi)
% t^{-d/p} | L_t m |_{L^p}
% S^{-d/p}_{p,infty}
for $1 \leq p \leq q \leq 2$. Thus regularity on the spatial and frequency side is necessary to ensure a Fourier multiplier is bounded. We note that Hausdorff-Young ensures that
%
\[ \widehat{\dot{B}^{d/q^*}_{q,\infty}}(\RR^d) \subset \dot{A}^{-d/p}_{q^*,\infty}, \]
%
which gives weaker control over the behaviour of the multiplier $m$ for large $\xi$ when compared to the condition of being an element of $\dot{A}^{-d/q}_{q^*,\infty}$, but stronger control for small $\xi$. But for \emph{unit scale multipliers}, the two conditions are equivalent, i.e. because only $O(1)$ Littlewood-Paley projections are non-zero.

%For a general, non compactly supported multiplier $m$, if $k_t$ is the convolution kernel associated with the multiplier $m_t$, then one obtains the condition
%
%\[ \sup_{t > 0} \left\{ t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \cdot \| k_t \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \right\} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}, \]
%
%One can phrase this bound in terms of the homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{p,q}_s(\RR^d)$, the space consisting of all distributions $u$ on $\RR^d$ such that the norm
%
%\[ \| u \|_{\dot{B}^{p,q}_s(\RR^d)} = \left( \sum_{j = -\infty}^\infty \left( 2^{js} \| P_j u \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \right)^q \right)^{1/q} = \| 2^{js} P_j u \|_{l^q(\ZZ) L^p(\RR^d)}, \]
%
%is finite, where $\{ P_j \}$ are a family of Little-wood Paley projection operators, with $P_j$ projecting onto a dyadic frequency band of radius $2^j$. If $k$ is the convolution kernel of a multiplier $m$, one can rescale the condition above to read that
%
%\[ \sup_{t > 0} \left\{ t^{-d/p^*} \| P_t k \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \right\} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}, \]
%
%i.e. that
%
%\[ \| k \|_{\dot{B}^{q,\infty}_{-d/p^*}} \lesssim \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
%Thus we conclude that $k$ must satisfy some (admittedly weak) regularity assumptions to be the convolution kernel of a bounded Fourier multiplier.

\section{The Radial Multiplier Conjecture}

Despite the continuing lack of a complete characterization of the classes $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$, it is surprising that we \emph{can} conjecture a characterization of the subspace of $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ consisting of \emph{radial symbols}, for an appropriate range of exponents. The conjectured range of estimates was first suggested by the result of \cite{GarrigosandSeeger}, which concerned radial multipliers $m$ whose associated operator $T$ is bounded from the $L^p$ norm to the $L^q$ norm \emph{restricted to radial functions}, i.e. such that the norm
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}_{\text{rad}}(\RR^d)} = \sup \left\{ \frac{\| Tf \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}}{\| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}} : f \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)\ \text{and $f$ is radial} \right\} \]
%
is finite. The main result of \cite{GarrigosandSeeger} is that if $d > 1$, if $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$, and if $1 \leq p \leq q < 2$, then $M^{p,q}_{\text{rad}}(\RR^d)$ is a subset of $L^1_{\text{loc}}(\RR^d)$, and for any radial multiplier $m$, if $k$ it's convolution kernel, then
%
\[ M^{p,q}_{\text{rad}}(\RR^d) = \widehat{B^{d/q^*}_{q,\infty}}(\RR^d), \]
%
%
%More generally, for any locally integrable radial symbol $m$,
%
%\[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}_{\text{rad}}(\RR^d)} \sim_{p,q,d} \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \| k_t \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} = \| k \|_{\dot{B}^{q,\infty}_{-d/p^*}}. \]
%
Moreover, this range of $p$ and $q$ gives give \emph{precisely the range} under which this characterization holds. It is natural to conjecture that the same constraint continues to hold when we remove the constraint that our inputs $f$ are radial, i.e. that for unit scale, integrable, radial symbols $m$, for $d > 1$, $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$, and for $p \leq q < 2$,
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \sim_{p,q,d} \| k \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \]
%
%and for general locally integrable symbols $m$,
%
%\[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}} \sim_{p,q,d} \| k \|_{\dot{B}_{-d/p^*}^{q,\infty}} \]
%
In the sequel, we call this the \emph{radial multiplier conjecture} in $\RR^d$.

\section{Range of Exponents in the Conjecture}

In this section, we show why the range of the radial multiplier cannot be improved, i.e. that the conjecture cannot hold for $p \geq 2d/(d+1)$. One can see quite easily that the conjecture cannot hold for $p > 2d/(d+1)$ by using the \emph{ball multiplier operator} analysis due to Fefferman \cite{Fefferman}, as a black box. To see why the result cannot hold when $p = 2d/(d+1)$, we apply an analogous argument to Fefferman's analysis (a reduction to Kakeya-type phenomena) applied to a family of \emph{Bochner-Riesz bump functions}, which shows a uniform bound for $p = 2d/(d+1)$ as suggested by the radial multiplier conjecture is impossible.

%
%For $p = 1$, the radial multiplier conjecture is true \emph{for compactly supported multipliers}, and one does not even need to assume that the multiplier is radial in this case. %Nonetheless, Littlewood-Paley does not hold in this setting.
%so an analogous result for radial multipliers which do not have compact support fails in some sense, i.e. we have
%
%\[ \| m \|_{M^{1,q}(\RR^d)} = \| k \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}, \]
%
%which for $q > 1$, is proportional to
%
%\[ \left( \sum \| P_j k \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2} = \| k \|_{\dot{B}^{q,2}_0}. \]
%
%On the other hand, for non compactly supported multipliers $m$ the radial multiplier conjecture should say that
%
%\[ \| m \|_{M^{1,q}(\RR^d)} \sim \| k \|_{\dot{B}^{q,\infty}_0}, \]
%
%so the result fails `in the second order exponents', because Littlewood-Paley theory no longer applies.
% x has units M
% xi has units 1/M
% m is unitless
% Then k = m^ has units M^{-d}
% t also has units 1/M
% The projections P_t m^ have units M^{-d} as well.
% The L^p norm of P_t m^ has units M^{-d} * M^{d/p} = M^{-d/p^*}
% t^s | P_t m^ |_{L^p} has units A M^{-s-d/p^*}
% The L^q_t norm of t^s | P_t m^ |_{L^p} has units M^{-s-d/p^*-d/q}
% The Besov norm of m^ has units M^{-s-d/p^*-d/q}
% k has units M^{-d}
% For a dimensionless function f, k * f is dimensionless
% So | k * f |_{L^q} has units M^{d/q}
% And |f|_p has units M^{d/p}
% so the M^{p,q} norm of m, which is the supremum of quantities | k * f |_q / |f|_p, which have units M^{d/q-d/p}, also has units M^{d/q - d/p}.
% r has units M
% The projections P_r m are unitsless
% The L^p norm of P_r m has units M^{-d/p}
% r^s | P_r m^ |_{L^p} has units M^{s - d/p}
% The L^q_r norm of r^s |P_r m^ |_{L^p} has units M^{s - d/p + d/q}
% M^{1,q} norm has units M^{-d/q^*}
% The B^{p,2}_0 norm of m^ has units M^{-d/p^*-d/2}
% Suppose -d/q^* = -d/p^* - d/2
% 1/p^* - 1/q^* + 1/2 = 0
% Not quite matching up.
%

Let's begin with the ball-multiplier argument, which is less technical. Consider the multiplier
%
\[ m(\xi) = \beta(|\xi|) \mathbf{I}(|\xi| \leq 1), \]
%
where $\beta$ is smooth, equal to one on $\{ 1/2 \leq |\xi| \leq 2 \}$, and has support on $\{ 1/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 4 \}$. Then the function $m$ differs from the ball multiplier $\mathbf{I}(|\xi| \leq 1)$ by a compactly supported, smooth symbol, and thus the $L^p$ mapping properties of the multiplier $m(D)$ are identically to the mapping properties of the ball multiplier. In particular, a result of \cite{Fefferman} guarantees the ball multiplier does not lie in $M^{p,q}(\RR^d)$ when $d > 1$ for any values of $p$ and $q$ except when $p = q = 2$, so the same is true of the multiplier $m$ given above. Now if $k$ is the convolution kernel of $m$, then integrating in polar coordinates gives that
%
\[ k(x) = \int_{0 \leq r \leq 5} r^{d-1} \beta(r) \widehat{\sigma}(r x)\; dr, \]
%
where $\sigma$ is the surface measure of the unit sphere. Standard stationary phase asymptotics show that
%
\[ \widehat{\sigma}(rx) = s_+(r |x|) e^{2 \pi i r |x|} + s_-(r |x|) e^{- 2 \pi i r |x|}, \]
%
where $s_+$ and $s_-$ are symbols of order $-(d-1)/2$. Integrating by parts gives that
%
\begin{align*}
    \int_0^1 r^{d-1} \beta(r) s_+(r|x|) e^{2 \pi i r |x|}\; dr &= \frac{s_+(|x|) e^{2 \pi i |x|}}{2 \pi i |x|}\\
    &\quad - \frac{1}{2 \pi i |x|} \int_0^1 \frac{d}{dr} \left\{ r^{d-1} \beta(r) s_+(r|x|) \right\} e^{2 \pi i r |x|}\; dr.
\end{align*}
%
Each of these terms is $O( |x|^{- \frac{d+1}{2}} )$. A similar result holds for $s_-$. Thus
%
\[ |k(x)| \lesssim \langle x \rangle^{- \frac{d+1}{2}}. \]
%
This allows us to conclude that $k \in L^q(\RR^d)$ for $q > 2d/(d+1)$. Because of the $L^p$ mapping properties of $m$, we conclude that the radial multiplier conjecture cannot hold for $2d/(d+1) < p < 2$, and for any $q \geq p$.

To show the radial multiplier conjecture cannot hold at the endpoint $p = 2d/(d+1)$, we must be slightly more careful in our analysis. To do this, we will find a family of smooth, unit scale multipliers $\{ m_\delta \}$ such that for $2d/(d+1) \leq p \leq q \leq 2$,
%
\[ \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\| m_\delta \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}}{\| k_\delta \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}} = \infty. \]
%
We will choose $\{ m_\delta \}$ to be more and more singular near the boundary of the unit ball as $\delta \to 0$, proceeding as in Fefferman's analysis. Consider the multiplier 
%
\[ m_\delta(\xi) = h \left( \frac{|\xi| - 1}{\delta} \right), \]
%
where $h \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ is supported on $|\lambda| \leq 1/2$. Thus $m_\delta$ is a Bochner-Riesz bump function, i.e. a smooth function supported on a $\delta$ neighborhood of the unit sphere. If $k_\delta$ is the convolution kernel corresponding to the multiplier $m_\delta$, then we calculate, as above, that
%
\begin{align*}
    k_\delta(x) = \int r^{d-1} h \left( \frac{r - 1}{\delta} \right) \widehat{\sigma}(rx)\; dr,
\end{align*}
%
can be written as a sum of terms of the form
%
\[ \int r^{d-1} h \left( \frac{r - 1}{\delta} \right) s_{\pm}(r|x|) e^{\pm 2 \pi i r |x|}\; dr, \]
%
where $s_{\pm}$ is a symbol of order $-(d-1)/2$. We focus on the $s_+$ term, with the $s_-$ term handled in an analogous fashion. The support of the integrand lies away from the origin, we can integrate by parts arbitrarily many times to write this integral as
%
\[ \left( \frac{-1}{2 \pi i |x|} \right)^N \int \left( \frac{d}{dr} \right)^N \left\{ r^{d-1} h \left( \frac{r-1}{\delta} \right) s_+(r|x|) \right\} e^{\pm 2 \pi i r |x|}\; dr. \]
%
Applying the product rule to the derivative, and then integrating over the width $\delta$ interval upon which the oscillatory integral is supported, we conclude that this term is $O_N( \delta^{1 - N} |x|^{- \frac{d-1}{2} -N} )$ for all $N \geq 0$. For $|x| \geq 1/\delta$, it's better to take the error estimates for large $N$, whereas for $|x| \leq 1/\delta$, it's better to take the error term with $N = 0$. In particular, when calculating the $L^q$ norm, using the trivial bound $\| k_\delta \|_{L^\infty} \leq \delta$ for $|x| \leq 1$, using the bound with $N = 0$ for $1 \leq |x| \leq \delta^{-1}$, and using the bound for arbitrarily large $N$ for $|x| \geq \delta^{-1}$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| k_\delta \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim_q \delta^{\frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{d}{q}}. \]
%
In particular, we note that the convolution kernels $\{ k_\delta \}$ are uniformly bounded in $\delta$ provided that $q \geq 2d/(d+1)$.
\begin{comment}
%
\begin{align*}
    k_\delta(|x|) &= 2 \pi |x|^{1 - d/2} \int_{1 - \delta}^{1 + \delta} h \left( \frac{\lambda - 1}{\delta} \right) J_{d/2 - 1}(2 \pi \lambda |x|) \lambda^{d/2}\; d\lambda\\
    &= 2 \pi \delta |x|^{1 - d/2} \int_{-1}^1 h(\lambda) J_{d/2 - 1}(2 \pi (\delta \lambda + 1) |x|) (\delta \lambda + 1)^{d/2}\; d\lambda.
\end{align*}
%
As we have seen, for $s \geq 1$, Bessel function asymptotics tell us that, for any $N > 0$, modulo an error of order $O_N(s^{-N-1/2})$, we can write $J_{d/2-1}(s)$ as a linear combination of terms of the form $s^{-k-1/2} e^{\pm is}$, for $0 \leq k < N-1$. Thus we can write $k_\delta(x)$, modulo an error of order
%
\[ O_N \Bigg( |x|^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - N} \delta^{-1/2-N} \Bigg), \]
%
as a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ \delta |x|^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - k} \int_{-1}^1 h(\lambda) (\delta \lambda + 1)^{ \frac{d-1}{2} -k} e^{\pm 2 \pi i (\delta \lambda + 1)}\; d\lambda, \]
%
for $0 \leq k < N-1$. Integrating by parts gives that these terms are, for any $L > 0$,
%
\[ O_L( \delta^{1-L} |x|^{-\frac{d-1}{2} - k - L} ). \]
%
Taking $L$ arbitrarily large gives that
%
\[ \int_{|x| \geq 1/\delta} |k_\delta(x)|^q \lesssim \delta^{q \frac{d+1}{2} - d}. \]
%
For $1 \leq |x| \leq 1/\delta$, we take $L = 0$, which yields that
%
\[ \int_{1 \leq |x| \leq 1/\delta} |k_\delta(x)|^q \lesssim \delta^{q \frac{d+1}{2} - d }. \]
%
Conversely, for $|x| \leq 1$, we use the trivial bound $|k_\delta(x)| \leq \| m_\delta \|_{L^1} \lesssim \delta$. Thus we have
%
\[ \int_{|x| \leq 1} |k_\delta(x)|^q \lesssim \delta^q. \]
%
Putting all these bounds together, together, for $q \geq 2d/(d-1)$ and $\delta \leq 1$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| k_\delta \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \delta^{- \frac{d}{q} + \frac{d+1}{2}}. \]
%
\end{comment}
If the radial multiplier conjecture held at this exponent, we would have for any Schwartz function $f \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$,
%
\[ \| k_\delta * f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \delta^{\frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{d}{q}} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}, \]
%
where the implicit constant is independent of $\delta$. We now use the existence of Kakeya sets, ala Fefferman's analysis, to justify that such a bound cannot be possible when $2d/(d+1) \leq p \leq 2$ and where $q \geq p$. It will be more convenient to dualize, and show that for $2 \leq p \leq 2d/(d-1)$ and $q \geq p$, a bound of the form
%
\[ \| k_\delta * f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} \lesssim \delta^{\frac{d}{p} - \frac{d-1}{2}} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \]
%
is not possible, which is equivalent to the original bound.

For each $\delta > 0$, we will choose a function $f_\delta$ so that the inequality above is not possible uniformly in $\delta$ as $\delta \to 0$. The function $f_\delta$ will be chosen to have Fourier support on the annulus $1 - 2 \delta \leq |\xi| \leq 1 + 2 \delta$. Cover the unit sphere of $\RR^d$ by a maximal collection $\Theta_\delta$ of $\delta$-separated points. Then $\#(\Theta_\delta) \sim \delta^{1-d}$. For each $\theta \in \Theta_\delta$, consider a cap centered at $(1 - 1.4\delta) \theta$, with length $\delta$ in the $\theta$ direction, and with length $\delta^{1/2}$ in the $d-1$ directions tangential to $\theta$. The choice is made so that $\kappa_\theta$ has essentially $10\%$ of it's mass on the support of $m_\delta$. We then consider a family of bump functions $\{ \phi_\theta \}$ supported on the family $\{ \kappa_\theta \}$, with magnitude roughly $\delta^{-(d+1)/2}$ on $\Theta_\delta$. For any points $\{ x_\theta : \theta \in \Theta \}$, consider the family of functions $\{ \chi_\theta \}$, with
%
\[ \widehat{\chi_\theta}(\xi) = e^{- 2 \pi i x_\theta \cdot \xi} \phi_\theta(\xi). \]
%
For each $\theta$, $\chi_\theta$ then has mass concentrated on the dual rectangle $T_\theta$ of $\kappa_\theta$, which is centered at $x_\theta$, and has magnitude roughly $\delta^{-(d+1)/2}$ on $T_\theta$. The action of the Fourier multiplier $m_\delta(\sqrt{-\Delta})$, roughly speaking, is to cut the Fourier support of $\chi_\theta$ by a tenth. We lose $90 \%$ of the Fourier mass of $\theta$, but our support is also made ten times thinner in the tangential direction. As a result, $k_\delta * \chi_\theta$ will now have mass concentrated on a tube $T_\theta^*$, with the same center, but which is ten times longer than $T_\theta$ in the tangential direction. Let's let $T_\theta^+$ be the portion of $T_\theta^*$ which lies at the opposite end of $T_\theta^*$ to $T_\theta$, but with the same dimensions as $T_\theta$.

Our construction now relies on \emph{Kakeya} like phenomena. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a large $\delta_0$ such that for $\delta \leq \delta_0$, we can pick $\{ x_\theta \}$ such that tubes $\{ T_\theta \}$ are disjoint from one another, but such that the tubes $\{ T_\theta^+ \}$ have large overlap, in the sense that
%
\[ | \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ | \leq \varepsilon | \bigcup_\theta T_\theta|. \]
%
The supports of $k_\delta * \chi_\theta$ thus have lots of overlap on this set. However, it is difficult to determine the sum $\sum_\theta k_\delta * \chi_\theta$, since these functions might have different signs where they overlap. To fix this, we define
%
\[ f_\delta = \sum_\theta \varepsilon_\theta \chi_\theta \]
%
where $\{ \varepsilon_\theta \}$ are independent $\{ -1, +1 \}$ valued Bernoulli random variables, because Khintchine's inequality implies that we have the pointwise inequality, for any $1 < r < \infty$, of the form
%
\[ \left( \EE \left| \sum_\theta \varepsilon_\theta \chi_\theta \right|^r \right)^{1/r} \sim \left( \sum_\Theta |\chi_\theta|^2 \right)^{1/2}. \]
%
It follows that, since the tubes $T_\theta$ are disjoint,
%
\begin{align*}
    \EE \| f_\delta \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^p &\sim \int \left( \sum_\theta |\chi_\theta(x)|^2 \right)^{p/2}\; dx\\
    &\sim \left( \delta^{- \frac{d+1}{2}} \right)^p \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right|.
\end{align*}
%
Similarily, Khintchine's inequality can again be applied to
%
\begin{align*}
    k_\delta * f_\delta &= \sum_\theta \varepsilon_\theta (k_\delta * \chi_\theta).
\end{align*}
%
to conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \EE \| k_\delta * f_\delta \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^q &\sim \int \left( \sum_\theta |k_\delta * \chi_\theta(x)|^2 \right)^{q/2}\; dx\\
    &\gtrsim \left( \delta^{- \frac{d+1}{2}} \right)^q \int \left( \sum_\theta \mathbf{I}_{T_\theta^+}(x) \right)^{q/2}\; dx.
\end{align*}
%
If the radial multiplier conjecture held for the exponents $p$ and $q$ considered, we would therefore conclude that by Jensen's inequality,
%
\begin{align*}
     \left( \delta^{- \frac{d+1}{2}} \right)^q \int \left( \sum_\theta \mathbf{I}_{T_\theta^+}(x) \right)^{q/2}\; dx &\lesssim \EE \| k_\delta * f_\delta \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^q\\
     &\lesssim \delta^{q \left( d/p - \frac{d-1}{2} \right)} \EE \| f_\delta \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^q\\
     &\lesssim \delta^{q \left( d/p - \frac{d-1}{2} \right)} \left( \EE \| f_\delta \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^p \right)^{q/p}\\
     &\lesssim \delta^{q \left( d/p - \frac{d-1}{2} \right)} \delta^{-q \left( \frac{d+1}{2} \right)} \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right|^{q/p}\\
     &\lesssim \left( \delta^{-d(1-1/p)} \right)^q \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right|^{q/p}.
\end{align*}
%
Rearranging, and taking the $q$th root on both sides, we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \left( \int \left( \sum_\theta \mathbf{I}_{T_\theta^+}(x) \right)^{q/2}\; dx \right)^{1/q} \lesssim \delta^{\frac{d}{p} - \frac{d-1}{2}} \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right|^{1/p}
\end{align*}
%
Interpolating the trivial bound
%
\[ \int \left( \sum_\theta \mathbf{I}_{T_\theta^+}(x) \right)\; dx \sim \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right| \]
%
with the fact that the sum is supported on the finite measure set $\bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+$ yields that
%
\[ \left( \int \left( \sum_\theta \mathbf{I}_{T_\theta^+}(x) \right)^{q/2}\; dx \right)^{1/q} \gtrsim \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right|^{-(1/2 - 1/q)} \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right|^{1/2}, \]
%
Substituting and rearranging, we obtain that
%
\[ \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right|^{1/2-1/p} \lesssim \delta^{d/p - \frac{d-1}{2}} \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right|^{1/2 - 1/q}. \]
%
Now $p \leq 2d/(d-1)$, which implies the exponent of $\delta$ is positive, which allows us to conclude that for $\delta \leq 1$,
% 2 <= q <= p
% 1/2 >= 1/q >= 1/p
\[ \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right| \lesssim \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right|^{\frac{1/2 - 1/q}{1/2 - 1/p}}. \]
%
Note that because $q \geq p \geq 2$,
%
\[ \frac{1/2 - 1/p}{1/2 - 1/q} \geq 1. \]
%
Thus if $|\bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+| \leq 1$,
%
\[ \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right| \lesssim \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right|^{\frac{1/2 - 1/q}{1/2 - 1/p}} \lesssim \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right|. \]
%
This is impossible, because the existence of Kakeya sets implies we can choose these tubes so that as $\delta \to 0$,
%
\[ \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right| = o \left( \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right| \right), \]
%
which would give a contradiction to this bound.

\begin{remark}
    The argument above can still be applied for general values $2 \leq p \leq q \leq \infty$, and shows that if the radial multiplier conjecture holds for certain estimates, then certainly Minkowski dimension bounds hold for all Kakeya sets. We should expect such an analysis, since the multiplier conjecture for a particular value of $p$ would imply the Bochner-Riesz conjecture for that same $p$, and \cite{Tao} shows this implies results for the restriction conjecture, and thus the Kakeya maximal conjecture.

    If we use the disjointness of the $\{ T_\theta \}$, we have that
    %
    \[ \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta \right| \sim \delta^{-\frac{3d-1}{2}}. \]
    %
    Thus we can rearrange the inequality to read that
    %
    \[ \left| \bigcup_\theta T_\theta^+ \right| \gtrsim \delta^{\frac{-1}{1 - 2/q} \left( \frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{d-1}{p} \right)}. \]
    %
    This bounds tells us more information about Kakeya sets. Namely, if $K$ is a Kakeya set, then we can choose a family of tubes $\{ T_\theta^+ \}$ as above, whose union is contained in a $\delta^{-1/2}$ neighborhood of $\delta^{-1} K$. It follows that if $\varepsilon = \delta^{1/2}$, then the volume of the $\varepsilon$ neighborhood $K_\varepsilon$ of $K$ satisfies the bound
    %
    \[ |K_\varepsilon| \gtrsim \varepsilon^{2d - \frac{1}{1/2 - 1/q} \left( \frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{d-1}{p} \right)}. \]
    %
    Taking $\varepsilon \to 0$, we conclude that $K$ has Minkowski dimension at least
    %
    \[ \frac{1}{1/2 - 1/q} \left( \frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{d-1}{p} \right) - d, \]
    % p = 2d/(d-1)
    % (d+1)/2 - (d-1)/2d
    and in fact for
    %
    \[ q < 4 \cdot \frac{p}{p+2} \cdot \frac{d}{d-1}, \]
    %
    we would conclude that $K$ must have positive Lebesgue measure, which would give a contradiction give the existence of Kakeya sets, and thus the conjecture certainly cannot hold for such exponents. For $p \geq 2(d+1)/(d-1)$, no such choice of $q$ exists with $q \geq p$ TODO: Why isn't this $p \geq 2d/(d-1)$?
\end{remark}

\section{Summary of Prior Results}

We now know, by results of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} that the radial multiplier conjecture is true when $d \geq 4$ and when $1 < p < (2d-2)/(d+1)$. A summary of the proof strategies of this argument is provided in Chapter \ref{HeoNazarovSeeger}. When $d = 4$, this was improved by Cladek \cite{Cladek}, who showed that the conjecture is true here when $1 < p < 36/29$, where $36/29 \approx (2d - 1.79)/(d+1)$. In the same paper, Cladek also established the first results in the $d = 3$ case, obtaining a \emph{restricted weak type} bound
% 
\[ \| Tf \|_{L^p(\RR^n)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p,1}(\RR^n)}, \]
% 13/12
where $1 < p < 13/12$, where $13/12 \approx (2d - 1.66)/(d+1)$. Summaries of the improvements Cladek obtained are described in Chapter \ref{Cladek}. But the radial multiplier conjecture has not yet been completely resolved in any dimension $n$, we do not have any strong type $L^p$ bounds when $d = 3$, and we don't have any bounds whatsoever when $d = 2$. One goal of this research project is to investigate whether one can use modern research techniques to improve upon these bounds.

The full proof of the radial multiplier is likely far beyond current research techniques. Indeed, it remains a major open problem in harmonic analysis to determine the range of exponents for which \emph{specific} radial Fourier multipliers are bounded in the range where the conjecture would apply, such as the Fourier multiplier on $\RR^d$ with symbol $m_\lambda(\xi) = \left( 1 - |\xi| \right)^\lambda_+$, the family of \emph{Bochner-Riesz multipliers}. The radial multiplier conjecture characterizes the range of the Bochner-Riesz multipliers, and thus the conjecture would also imply the Kakeya and restriction conjectures. All three of these results are major unsolved problems in harmonic analysis. On the other hand, the Bochner Riesz conjecture is completely resolved when $d = 2$, while in contrast, no results related to the radial multiplier conjecture are known in this dimension at all. And in any dimension $d > 2$, the range under which the Bochner-Riesz multiplier is known to hold \cite{GuoandOhandWangandWuandZhang} is strictly larger than the range under which the radial multiplier conjecture is known to hold, even for the restricted weak-type bounds obtained in \cite{Cladek}. Thus it still seems within hope that the techniques recently applied to improve results for Bochner-Riesz problem, such as broad-narrow analysis \cite{BourgainandGuth}, the polynomial Wolff axioms \cite{KatzandRogers}, and methods of incidence geometry and polynomial partitioning \cite{Zahl2} can be applied to give improvements to current results characterizing the boundedness of general radial Fourier multipliers.

Our hopes are further emboldened when we consult the proofs in \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} and \cite{Cladek}, which reduce the radial multiplier conjecture to the study of upper bounds of quantities of the form
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{(y,r) \in \mathcal{E}} F_{y,r} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^n)}, \]
%
where $\mathcal{E} \subset \RR^n \times (0,\infty)$ is a finite collection of pairs, and $F_{y,r}$ is an oscillating function supported on a $O(1)$ neighborhood of a sphere of radius $r$ centered at a point $y$. The $L^p$ norm of this sum is closely related to the study of the tangential intersections of these spheres, a problem successfully studied in more combinatorial settings using incidence geometry and polynomial partitioning methods \cite{Zahl}, which provides further estimates that these methods might yield further estimates on the radial multiplier conjecture.

When $d = 3$, the results of \cite{Cladek} are only able to obtain bounds on the $L^p$ sums in the last paragraph when $\mathcal{E}$ is a Cartesian product of two subsets of $(0,\infty)$ and $\RR^d$. This is why only restricted weak-type bounds have been obtained in this dimension. It is therefore an interesting question whether different techniques enable one to extend the $L^p$ bounds of these sums when the set $\mathcal{E}$ is \emph{not} a Cartesian product, which would allow us to upgrade the result of \cite{Cladek} in $d = 3$ to give strong $L^p$ bounds. This question also has independent interest, because it would imply new results for the `sharp' local smoothing conjecture, which concerns the regularity of solutions to the wave equation in $\RR^d$. Incidence geometry has been recently applied to yield results on the `non-sharp' local smoothing conjecture \cite{GuthandWangandZhang}, which again suggests these techniques might be applied to yield the estimates needed to upgrade the result of \cite{Cladek} to give strong $L^p$-type bounds.

\section{Bessel Transforms and Radial Multipliers}
\label{besselequivalencesection}

Given a function $h$ on $[0,\infty)$, we define the \emph{$d$-dimensional Fourier-Bessel transform} of $h$ as
%
 \[ \mathcal{B}_d h(r) = r^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \int_0^\infty \rho^{d/2} h(\rho) J_{d/2-1}(\rho r)\; d\rho, \]
%
where $J_{d/2-1}$ is the Bessel function of order $d/2 - 1$. If $m$ is the function on $\RR^d$ defined by setting $m(\xi) = h(|\xi|)$, then
%
\[ \widehat{m}(x) = \mathcal{B}_d h(|x|). \]
%
The condition in the radial multiplier conjecture for unit scale multipliers can thus be restated that
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \sim \left( \int_0^\infty r^{d-1} |\mathcal{B}_d h(r)|^q\; dr \right)^{1/q}. \]
%
%We therefore conclude that, if we let $h_t = \phi \cdot \text{Dil}_{1/t} h$, then the condition in the radial multiplier conjecture becomes
%
%\[ \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \left( \int_0^\infty r^{d-1} |\{ \mathcal{B}_d h_t \}(r)|^q \right)^{1/q} < \infty. \]
%
One can use Bessel function asymptotics to relate this quantity to a condition on the one-dimensional Fourier transform of $h$ (extended to an even function on $\RR$), if $h$ is a unit scale multiplier. Indeed, in \cite{GarrigosandSeeger}, Garrig\'{o}s and Seeger show that for $1 < q < 2$, for such multipliers, we have
%
\[ \left( \int_0^\infty r^{d-1} |\mathcal{B}_d h(r)|^q\; dr \right)^{1/q} \sim_{d,q} \left( \int_0^\infty \langle \lambda \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)} |\widehat{h}(\lambda)|^q \right)^{1/q}. \]
%
Let us briefly prove this equivalence.

\begin{theorem}
    TODO
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Write the left hand side as $A$, and the right hand side as $B$. We will begin by proving that $A \lesssim B$. To begin with, using the fact that $h$ is even, we can write
    %
    \[ \mathcal{B}_d h(r) = r^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \sum_{\pm} \int_0^\infty \rho^{d/2} h(\rho) s_{\pm}(\rho r) e^{\pm 2 \pi i \rho r}\; d\rho, \]
    %
    where $s_+$ and $s_-$ are symbols of order $-1/2$. In particular, expanding out the asymptotics of the symbols, we see that for any $N > 0$, we can write $\mathcal{B}_d h(r)$ as a linear combination of terms of the form
    %
    \[ r^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - \alpha} \int_0^\infty \rho^{\frac{d-1}{2} - \alpha} h(\rho) e^{\pm 2 \pi i \rho r}\; d\rho \]
    %
    for $|\alpha| < N$, plus a remainder term given by
    %
    \[ \sum_{\pm} r^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \int_0^\infty \rho^{d/2} h(\rho) a_{\pm}(\rho r) e^{\pm 2 \pi i \rho r}, \]
    %
    where $a_+$ and $a_-$ are symbols of order $-1/2 - N$. If $k_{\pm,N}$ is the inverse Fourier transform of $\rho^{N - 1/2} a_{\pm}(\rho)$, then we can write the remainder above as a linear combination of terms of the form
    %
    \[ r^{- N - \frac{d-1}{2}} \int k_{\pm,N}(t / r) [D^{d/2 - N + 1/2} \widehat{h}](\pm r - t)\; dt. \]
    %
    The fact that $\rho^{N-1/2} a_{\pm}(\rho)$ is a symbol of order $-1$ implies that we have
    %
    \[ |k_{\pm,N}(t)| \lesssim_N 1. \]
    % - d/2 + 1 - 1 + 1/2 - N
    % -(d-1)/2 - N
    Set
    %
    \[ Rf(r) = \int k_{\pm,N}(t/r) f(\pm r - t)\; dt. \]
    %
    A weighted version of Schur's Lemma, together with this bound, implies that if $N$ is suitably large, then
    %
    \[ \left( r^{(d-1) - q \left(N + \frac{d-1}{2} \right)} |Rf(r)|^q \right)^{1/q} \lesssim \left( \langle \lambda \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)} |f(r)|^q. \right)^{1/q} \]
    %
    TODO


    where $|k(t)| \lesssim_N \langle t \rangle^{-N}$ for all $N > 0$.

     given by replacing $s_{\pm}$ with it's order $\leq $
    %
    \[ r^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - N} \left( (\partial_i^{d/2} \widehat{h}) *  \right)(\pm r) \]
    %
    \[ O_N \left( \langle r \rangle^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - N} \right). \]
    %
    The terms above for a particular $\alpha$ can be written as a constant multiple of
    %
    \[ r^{- \frac{d-2}{2} - \alpha} \left(\partial^\alpha \widehat{h} \right)(\pm r). \]
    %
    Applying the triangle inequality to each of these terms, we see that
\end{proof}

This characterization of the conclusion of the radial multiplier conjecture will come in handy later on when we discuss the extension of the radial multiplier conjecture to Riemannian manifolds. In the sequel, we let
%
\[ C_q(h) = \left( \int_0^\infty \langle \lambda \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)} |\widehat{h}(\lambda)|^q \right)^{1/q}. \]
%
Thus the radial multiplier conjecture, restricted to unit scale radial multipliers $m(\xi) = h(|\xi|)$, is to determine whether, for certain $p$ and $q$, $\| m \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} \sim C_q(h)$.
%    If $m(\xi) = h(|\xi|)$ is radial, the condition that
    %
%    \[ \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \| k_t \|_{L^q(\RR^d)} < \infty \]
    %
%    can be rephrased in terms involving the Fourier transform of $h$. Namely, we have
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        & \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \| k_t \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}\\
%        &\quad\quad \sim \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \left( \int_{t/2 \leq |s| \leq 2t} |\widehat{h}(s)|^q (1 + |s|)^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)}\; dt \right)^{1/q}.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    The weight inside the norm prevents us from easily converting this condition into a homogeneous Besov condition on the function $w$, but roughly speaking, we have $|\widehat{h}(s)| \lesssim s^{d(1/p-1/q)} \langle s \rangle^{-(d-1)(1-q/2)}$ for \emph{most} inputs $x$.

\section{Multipliers on Riemannian Manifolds}

Fix a geodesically complete Riemannian manifold $X$. The operator $\sqrt{-\Delta}$, defined initially on $C_c^\infty(X)$, is then essentially self-adjoint on $L^2(X)$. The spectral calculus of unbounded operators can then be used to define operators of the form $h(\sqrt{-\Delta})$ for each locally bounded, Borel measurable function $h: [0,\infty) \to \CC$. These operators are analogous to the radial multipliers studied in the Euclidean setting, and we will also call these operators \emph{radial multipliers on $X$}. Just like multiplier operators on $\RR^d$ are crucial to an understanding of the interactions between the functions $e_\xi(x) = e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$ on $\RR^n$, understanding the operators $h(\sqrt{-\Delta})$ is crucial to understanding the interactions of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the manifold $X$.

We let $M^{p,q}(X, \sqrt{-\Delta} )$ denote the family of all locally bounded, Borel measurable functions $h$ such that the operator $T_h = h(\sqrt{-\Delta})$ extends to a bounded operator from $L^p(X)$ to $L^q(X)$, with the analogous operator norm, though, when there is no ambiguity, we will overload notation and write this space as $M^{p,q}(X)$.

To avoid technicalities, we will mainly focus on the study of radial multipliers on \emph{compact} Riemannian manifolds. Such manifolds are automatically geodesically complete. Moreover, on such a manifold, the spectrum of $\Delta$ forms a discrete set $\Lambda \subset (0,\infty)$, and for each $\lambda \in \Lambda$, there is a finite dimensional space $H_\lambda \subset C^\infty(X)$, such that we have an orthogonal decomposition
%
\[ L^2(X) = \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \Lambda} H_\lambda, \]
%
and for $f \in H_\lambda$, we have $\Delta f = - \lambda^2 f$. Such a function is called a \emph{Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction}. For any function $h: [0,\infty) \to \CC$, we then have that for $f \in C^\infty(X)$,
%
\[ h(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} h(\lambda) P_\lambda f, \]
%
where $P_\lambda: L^2(X) \to H_\lambda$ is orthogonal projection onto $H_\lambda$. If, for each $H_\lambda$, we fix an orthonormal basis $\{ e_{\lambda,n} \}$, then we can write
%
\[ h(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} \sum_n h(\lambda) \langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle e_{\lambda,n}, \]
%
Thus $h(\sqrt{-\Delta})$ is diagonalized by the basis $\{ e_{\lambda,n} \}$.

There are several model cases of study, each of which having constant curvature and a sufficient amount of symmetry to be able to describe the class of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The torii $\TT^d = \RR^d / \ZZ^d$, for which
    %
    \[ \Lambda = \big\{ \sqrt{n}: n > 0 \big\}, \]
    %
    and for which $H_\lambda$ is, for each $\lambda \in \Lambda$, spanned by the functions of the form
    %
    \[ e_\xi(x) = e^{i \xi \cdot x} \]
    %
    where $\xi \in \ZZ^d$, and $|\xi| = \lambda$. The study of radial multipliers in this setting is thus naturally connected to the theory of Fourier series, and is very similar to the theory of multipliers on $\RR^d$.

    \item The sphere $S^d$ in $\RR^{d+1}$. Here
    %
    \[ \Lambda = \left\{ \sqrt{n(n+d-1)}: n > 0 \right\} \]
    %
    If $\lambda_n = \sqrt{n(n+d-1)}$, then $H_{\lambda_n}$ is the space of all \emph{spherical harmonics} of degree $n$. Then
    % a^{d-1} - (a - 2)^{d-1}
    % O(a^{d-2})
    \[ \dim(H_{\lambda_n}) = \binom{d + n - 1}{n} - \binom{d + n - 3}{n - 2} \lesssim_d n^{d-2}. \]
    %
    The theory of the Laplacian on $S^d$ is closely connected to the representation theory of the non-commutative Lie group $SO(d+1)$.

    \item For a discrete, cocompact subgroup $\Gamma \subset PSL(d,\RR)$, we can consider the Riemannian manifold $\mathbb{H}^d / \Gamma$, obtained by quotienting hyperbolic space by the family of isometries corresponding to $\Gamma$. It is not quite as easy to explicitly write the eigenfunctions of this manifold, but the spectral theory of $\Delta$ is closely tied to the study of the representation theory of the non-commutative group Lie group $G / \Gamma$.
\end{itemize}
%
The Killing-Hopf theorem says that every manifold of constant curvature has either $\RR^d$, $S^d$, or $\mathbb{H}^d$ as a universal cover, so these provide a good family of simple manifolds, with a fairly clear family of eigenfunctions, with which we can begin our analysis.

Setting up the regularity study of multipliers on a compact Riemannian manifold has a certain technical problem not present in the Euclidean problem. If $h$ has compact support, then the operator
%
\[ h \left( \sqrt{-\Delta} \right) f = \sum h(\lambda_n) \langle f, e_n \rangle \cdot e_n \]
%
has a finite sum on the right hand side, and each term of the sum is individually well behaved, since $e_n$ is smooth. And so by the triangle inequality, any such operator will be trivially bounded from $L^p(X)$ to $L^q(X)$ for any exponents $p$ and $q$. Thus $M^{p,q}(X)$ contains all compactly supported radial multipliers, trivializing the study of compactly supported radial multipliers. This is the complete opposite of the Euclidean case, where dyadic decomposition type technology allowed us to reduce the study of general multipliers to compactly supported radial multipliers. The key step to fixing this problem is to recognize that Euclidean multipliers automatically have rescaling symmetries which prevent the case of compact support from being trivial, whereas this is not present in the case of compact Riemannian manifolds. To get around this we add a rescaling symmetry into our problem, i.e. we study conditions that ensure we have a bound of the form
%
\[ \sup_R R^{d(1/q - 1/p)} \| \text{Dil}_R h \|_{M^{p,q}(X)} < \infty. \]
%
The exponent of $R$ here emerges from the fact that
%
\[ \| \text{Dil}_R h \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)} = R^{-d(1/q - 1/p)} \| h \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
We let $M^{p,q}_{\text{Dil}}(X)$ denote the family of all multipliers for which the inequality above holds, and give it the norm induced by the quantity on the left hand side, and set $M^p_{\text{Dil}}(X) = M^{p,p}_{\text{Dil}}(X)$. A transference principle of Mitjagin \cite{Mitjagin} (See \cite{KenigStantonTomas} for a similar result, written in English and available online) shows that if $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $h: (0,\infty) \to \CC$ is a bounded, Borel measurable function, then
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d, \sqrt{-\Delta})} \lesssim_{X,p,q} \| h \|_{M^{p,q}_{\text{Dil}}(X, \sqrt{-\Delta})}. \]
%
Thus, in some sense, the dilation-invariant Fourier multiplier problem on a compact manifold $X$ is at least as hard as it is on $\RR^d$. Another goal of this research project is to extend the radial multiplier conjecture to the setting of dilation invariant bounds for multipliers of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds.

The study of dilation invariant radial multipliers on $\TT^d$ is essentially the same as on $\RR^d$, as we might guess from the crude observation that the family of eigenfunctions to the Laplacian are similar in both domains. More precisely, we can show that for any locally bounded, Borel measurable function $h: (0,\infty) \to \RR$, such that every point in $(0,\infty)$ is a Lebesgue point of $h$,
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{p,q}_{\text{Dil}}(\TT^d)} \sim_{p,q,d} \| h \|_{M^{p,q}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
A proof of this result is given by Theorem 3.6.7 of \cite{Grafakos}. Whether an analogous result remains true for more general Riemannian manifolds remains unclear, since the family of eigenfunctions to the Laplacian can take on various different forms on these manifolds, that can look quite different to the Euclidean case (TODO: Does the existence of low dimension Kakeya sets on certain manifolds show that the radial multiplier conjecture cannot be true in general).

What \emph{is} easy to establish is that the theory of multipliers in $M^2_{\text{Dil}}(X)$ is relatively the same. Indeed, applying orthogonality, we calculate that for any function $h: (0,\infty) \to \CC$, we have
%
\begin{align*}
    \| h(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f \|_{L^2(X)} &= \left\| \sum_\lambda h(\lambda) E_\lambda f \right\|_{L^2(X)}\\
    &= \left( \sum_\lambda |h(\lambda)|^2 \| E_\lambda f \|_{L^2(X)}^2 \right)^{1/2}\\
    &\leq \left( \sup_{\lambda \in \sigma(\sqrt{-\Delta})} |h(\lambda)| \right) \left( \sum_\lambda \| E_\lambda f \|_{L^2(X)}^2 \right)^{1/2}\\
    &= \left( \sup_{\lambda \in \sigma(\sqrt{-\Delta})} |h(\lambda)| \right) \| f \|_{L^2(X)}.
\end{align*}
%
Taking $f$ to be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue $\lambda$ which maximizes the value of $|h(\lambda)|$ shows this inequality is tight, i.e. we have
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{2,2}(X)} = \sup_{\lambda \in \sigma(\sqrt{-\Delta})} |h(\lambda)|. \]
%
Now applying an arbitrary dilation to $h$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{2,2}_{\text{Dil}} (X)} = \sup_{\lambda > 0} |h(\lambda)|. \]
%
Thus $M^2_{\text{Dil}}(X)$ consists precisely of the bounded functions on $(0,\infty)$.

How about the spaces $M^{p,2}(X)$, for $1 \leq p < 2$? We know by the transference principle that any multiplier $h$ in $M^{p,2}_{\text{Dil}}(X)$ must satisfy a bound of the form
%
\[ \left( \int_0^\infty r^{d-1} |h(r)|^q \right)^{1/q} < \infty, \]
%
where $q = 2p/(2-p)$. Is this sufficient? The analogous characterization on $\RR^d$ is proved using the Hausdorff-Young inequality, plus orthogonality. One way to state the Hausdorff-Young inequality on $\TT^d$ is that for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, and $f \in C^\infty(\TT^d)$,
%
\[ \left( \sum_\lambda \sum_n |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \leq \| f \|_{L^p(\TT^d)}. \]
%


%
% (d-1)/q <= (d-1)(2 - q)/4q
% 1/q <= (2-q)/4q
% q <= -2


%
To obtain an analogous result on a general compact manifold $X$, we can interpolate Parseval's inequality
%
\[ \left( \sum_\lambda \sum_n |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle|^2 \right)^2 \leq \| f \|_{L^2(X)}. \]
%
with
%
\[ \| P_\lambda f \|_{L^2(M)} \]
\[ \left( \sum_\lambda \| P_\lambda f \| \right) \]

with the results of Sogge (TODO: FIND PAPER) that say that
%
\[ \sup_{\lambda,n} |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle| \lambda^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^1(X)}, \]
%
which yields that for $1 \leq p < 2$, that
% 1/p^* = a/infty + (1-a)/2
% a = 1 - 2/p^*
\[ \left( \sum_{\lambda,n} |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle|^{p^*} \lambda^{- (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(X)}. \]
%
We therefore conclude that for $f \in C^\infty(X)$,
%
\begin{align*}
    &\| h(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f \|_{L^2(X)}\\
    &\quad= \left( \sum_\lambda \sum_n |h(\lambda)|^2 |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle|^2 \right)^{1/2}\\
    &\quad= \Bigg( \sum_\lambda \sum_n \Big[ |h(\lambda)|^2 \lambda^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)(2/p^*)} \Big]\\
    &\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \Big[ |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle|^2 \lambda^{-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)(2/p^*)} \Big] \Bigg)^{1/2}\\
    &\quad\leq \left( \sum_\lambda \sum_n |h(\lambda)|^{\frac{2p}{2-p}} \lambda^{(d-1)(1 - 1/p)} \right)^{\frac{2-p}{2p}}\\
    &\quad\quad\quad\quad \left( \sum |\langle f, e_{\lambda,n} \rangle|^{p^*} \lambda^{-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \right)^{1/p^*}\\
    &\quad\lesssim \left( \sum_\lambda \sum_n |h(\lambda)|^q \lambda^{(d-1)(1 - 1/p)} \right)^{1/q} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}.
\end{align*}
%
In the model case of $S^d$, we have that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| h(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f \|_{L^2(X)} &\lesssim \left( \sum_n |h(\lambda_n)|^q n^{2(d-1)(1 - 1/p) + (d-2)} \right)^{1/q} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}\\
    &\lesssim \left( \sum_n |h(\lambda_n)|^q n^{(d-1)(2(1 - 1/p) + 1) - 1} \right)^{1/q} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}.
\end{align*}
%
In particular, we have that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| h \|_{M^{p,2}_{\text{Dil}}(X)} &\lesssim \sup_R \left( \sum_\lambda \sum_n |h(\lambda_n/R)|^q n^{(d-1)(2(1 - 1/p) + 1) - 1} \right)^{1/q}.
\end{align*}
%
TODO: Determine if we can do something more optimal here. TODO: In light of Sogge's bounds, there's probably a counterexample here.

The spaces $M^{1,q}_{\text{Dil}}(X)$ are a little more tricky, since we do not have a precise theory of the Fourier transform in the general setting of Riemannian manifolds. To take a look at these bounds, we recall that $L^1 \to L^q$ bounds of an operator are characterized by Schur's test. If $\{ e_n \}$ is a $C^\infty(X)$ basis of eigenfunctions on $X$, with $\Delta e_n = - \lambda_n^2 e_n$, then
%
\[ h(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f(x) = \sum h(\lambda_n) \langle f, e_n \rangle e_n(x) = \int \left( \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} \right) f(y)\; dy. \]
%
Thus the kernel of $h(\sqrt{-\Delta})$ is precisely $K(x,y) = \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}$, and we conclude by Schur's test that
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{1,q}(X)} = \left\| \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} \right\|_{L^\infty_y L^q_x}. \]
%
In the case $X = \RR^n$, the analogous kernel is
%
\[ K(x,y) = \int_{\RR^d} h(|\xi|) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x} \overline{e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot y}}, \]
%
which can be explicitly reduced to $K(x,y) = \mathcal{B}_d h(|x - y|)$, and the condition of being contained in $M^{1,q}(\RR^d)$ then becomes that
%
\[ \left( \int r^{d-1} |\mathcal{B}_d h(r)|^q\; dr \right)^{1/q} < \infty. \]
%
If $h$ is compactly supported, and $1 < q < 2$, then we have seen that this condition is equivalent to the condition that
%
\[ \left( \int \langle t \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)} |\widehat{h}(t)|^q\; dt \right)^{1/q} < \infty. \]
%
In the general setting we do not have quite as nice a formula, but we can still \emph{force} the Fourier transform into the equation to see if it can be used to understand these quantities (which will be necessary for studying the radial multiplier conjecture). There are two approaches here, the first approach is to write
%
\begin{align*}
    K(x,y) &= \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}\\
    &= \sum_n \left( \int \widehat{h}(t) e^{2 \pi i t \lambda_n} e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}\; dt \right) \\
    &= \int \widehat{h}(t) \left( \sum_n e^{2 \pi i t \lambda_n} e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} \right)\; dt\\
    &= \int \widehat{h}(t) HW_t(x,y)\; dt,
\end{align*}
%
where $HW_t(x,y) = \sum_n e^{2 \pi i t \lambda_n} e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}$ is the kernel of the \emph{half-wave propogator} $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}$ on $X$. The connection between radial multipliers on $X$ and the Fourier transform of their symbol is therefore closely related to the study of the solutions to the half-wave equation $\partial_t = \sqrt{-\Delta}$ on $X$. Alternatively, we can employ the cosine transform, since $h$ is assumed to be extended to an even function, and write
%
\begin{align*}
    K(x,y) &= \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}\\
    &= \sum_n \left( 2 \int_0^\infty \widehat{h}(t) \cos(2 \pi t \lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}\; dt \right)\\
    &= 2 \int_0^\infty \widehat{h}(t) \left( \sum_n \cos(2 \pi t \lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} \right)\; dt\\
    &= 2 \int_0^\infty \widehat{h}(t) W_t(x,y)\; dt,
\end{align*}
%
where $W_t(x,y)$ is the kernel of the \emph{wave propogator} $\cos(2 \pi t \sqrt{-\Delta})$ on $X$. Thus the connenction of radial multipliers on $X$ and their Fourier transform is related to the study of the solutions to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 = \Delta$. The half-wave equation and the wave equation are certainly connected, but the latter has the advantage of finite speed of propogation.

An analogous characterization of the form
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{1,q}(X)} \lesssim \left( \int \langle t \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)} |\widehat{h}(t)|^q\; dt \right)^{1/q} \]
%
would follow if and only if we could prove a general inequality of the form
%
\[ \left\| \int a(t) W_t(x,y)\; dt \right\|_{L^\infty_y L^q_x} \lesssim \left( \int \langle t \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)} |a(t)|^q\; dt \right)^{1/q} \]
%
to hold. By interpolation, it would suffice to prove that
%
\[ \left\| \int a(t) W_t(x,y)\; dt \right\|_{L^\infty_y L^{1,\infty}_x} \lesssim \int \langle t \rangle^{\frac{d-1}{2}} |a(t)|\; dt \]
%
and
%
\[ \left\| \int a(t) W_t(x,y)\; dt \right\|_{L^\infty_y L^{2,\infty}_x} \lesssim \left( \int |a(t)|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2} \]


By finite speed of propogation, we may replace this over an integral of $x$ over a ball of radius $t$ about $y$. This integral does become singular as we approach $x$ near the boundary of this ball, i.e. it blows up like $(t^2 - d(x,y)^2)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}$. This is non-integral, unless $d = 2$, in which case the integral scales like $\theta(t)$. Thus the $L^1$ integral becomes

% r = t sin(theta)
% dr = t cos(theta) dtheta
\begin{align*}
    \int_0^t & r^{d-1} (t^2 - r^2)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}\; dr\\
    &= t \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin(\theta)^{d-1} \cos(\theta)^{2-d}\; d\theta.
\end{align*}

One way to interpret $\int a(t) W_t(x,y)\; dt\; dx$ is as th



TODO: What techniques can we use to obtain this bound? TODO: Can we come up with a proof of this bound in the model case $X = \RR^d$, i.e. an alternate proof of the characterization of $L^1 \to L^q$ boundedness? TODO: Can we apply the theory of fourier integral operators here?
%
%H\"{o}lder is \emph{not} good enough in this situation, since it leads to quantities of the form
%
%\[ \| (1 + |t|)^{-(d-1)(1 - q/2)} W_t \|_{L^\infty_y L^q_x L^{q^*}_t}, \]
%
%and the singularities of $W_t$ on the light cone mean the $L^{q^*}_t$ norm is infinite for all $x$ and $y$. But we should expect to do better than H\"{o}lder, since we only expect H\"{o}lder's inequality to be tight when $\widehat{h}$ is close to a scalar multiple to $t \mapsto W_t(x,y)$, and this cannot be true for all $x$ and $y$. TODO: Think about this more.

Directly translating the assumptions of the radial multiplier conjecture to this setting yields the following statement: If $h: [0,\infty) \to \RR$ is a function supported at the unit scale, and we define
%
\[ C_q(h) = \left( \int |\widehat{h}(s)|^q \langle s \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)}\; ds \right)^{1/q}, \]
%\[ C_{p,q}(h) = \sup_{t > 0} t^{d(1/p - 1/q)} \left( \int |\widehat{h}_t(s)|^q (1 + |s|)^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)}\; ds \right)^{1/q}, \]
%
then for what values of $p$ and $q$ is is true that the inequality
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{p,q}_{\text{Dil}}(X)} \lesssim C_q(h) \]
%
holds. Mitjagin's result implies that we require $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$ and $p \leq q < 2$, and we conjecture that, perhaps under appropriate assumptions on $X$, we can achieve similar ranges of exponents as have been obtained for the Euclidean radial multiplier conjecture.

On general compact manifolds, there are difficulties arising from a generalization of the radial multiplier conjecture, connected to the fact that analogues of the Kakeya / Nikodym conjecture are false in this general setting \cite{Minicozzi}. But these problems do not arise for constant curvature manifolds, like the sphere. The sphere also has over special properties which make it especially amenable to analysis, such as the fact that solutions to the wave equation on spheres are periodic. Best of all, there are already results which achieve the analogue of \cite{GarrigosandSeeger} on the sphere. Thus it seems reasonable that current research techniques can obtain interesting results for radial multipliers on the sphere, at least in the ranges established in \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} or even those results in \cite{Cladek}.

\section{Summary}

In conclusion, the results of \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} and \cite{Cladek} indicate three lines of questioning about radial Fourier multiplier operators, which current research techniques place us in reach of resolving. The first question is whether we can extend the range of exponents upon which the conjecture of \cite{GarrigosandSeeger} is true, at least in the case $d = 2$ where Bochner-Riesz has been solved. The second is whether we can use more sophisticated arguments to prove the $L^p$ sum bounds obtained in \cite{Cladek} when $d = 3$ when the sums are no longer Cartesian products, thus obtaining strong $L^p$ characterizations in this settiong, as well as new results about the sharp local smoothing conjecture. The third question is whether we can generalize these bounds obtained in these two papers to study radial Fourier multipliers on the sphere. 








\chapter{Local Symplectic Geometry}

There is an inherent symplectic structure to the study of oscillatory integrals. Indeed, given any distribution expressed by an oscillatory integral of the form
%
\[ u(x) = \int a(x,\theta) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,\theta)}, \]
%
and under the assumption that $\phi$ is \emph{non-degenerate}, i.e. it is homogeneous of degree one in the $\theta$ variable and satisfies the property that
%
\[ D_{x,\theta}(\nabla_\theta \phi)\ \text{has full rank whenever}\ \nabla_\theta \phi = 0, \]%
then the set
%
\[ \{ (x,\nabla_x \phi): \nabla_\theta \phi = 0 \} \]
%
is a \emph{Lagrangian submanifold} of the symplectic manifold $\RR^n \times \RR^n$. Since we deal with oscillatory integrals localized in space, we will profit from a more in depth understanding of the \emph{local} theory of symplectic geometry.

% Since we deal with oscillatory integrals localized to a region, we will profit from an understanding of the \emph{local} theory of symplectic geometry. This will be especially profitable since, unlike the study of Riemannian manifolds, where two manifolds can look very different locally, \emph{all} symplectic manifolds with the same dimension are locally symplectomorphic.

A \emph{symplectic vector space} $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space equipped with a non-degenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear form $\omega$, which we call a \emph{symplectic form}. Here are two useful examples:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item For any vector space $W$, the vector space $V = W \oplus W^*$ is naturally a symplectic vector space, equipped with the symplectic form
    %
    \[ \omega((x_1,\xi_1),(x_2,\xi_2)) = \langle \xi_2, x_1 \rangle - \langle \xi_1, x_2 \rangle. \]
    %
    In particular, for any $n$, $\RR^n \times \RR^n$ is naturally a symplectic manifold.

    \item Let $V = \CC^n$, viewed as a real-vector space of dimension $2n$. We let
    %
    \[ \omega(z,w) = - \text{Im} \left( z \cdot \overline{w} \right). \]
    %
    Then $V$ is a symplectic vector space.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
    Symplectic geometry original arose in the study of physical problems, and so it is helpful to use physical intuition in the study of symplectic manifolds. Consider a force field $F: \RR^3 \to \RR^3$ in space, with $F(x) = v$ for all $x \in \RR^3$, and some fixed vector $v \in \RR^3$. Then $F$ is conservative, and so each particle with unit mass, at a point $x \in \RR^3$ and having momentum $\xi \in \RR^3$, has a well defined energy given by the function
    %
    \[ E(x,\xi) = \frac{\xi^2}{2} - v \cdot x, \]
    %
    the sum of kinetic and potential energies. If we consider a small pertubation $(dx,d\xi)$ of the position and momentum of a particle, then, to first order, the energy will change by
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\; dx + \frac{\partial E}{\partial \xi}\; d\xi = - v\; dx + \xi\; d\xi. \]
    %
    Notice this quantity is $\omega( (\xi,v), (dx,d\xi))$. Thus the bilinear function $\omega$ measures the amount of energy required to change the location of a particle in position-momentum space by $(dx,d\xi)$, such that the physical system wants to travel in the direction $(\xi,v)$. Under this interpretation, it is completely natural to see that $\omega$ is skew-adjoint, because of the principle of conservation of energy. This intuition continues to hold if $F$ is a general conservative vector field. We will return to this discussion using a more differential geometric language later on in this chapter.
\end{remark}
%
Spectral arguments can be used to show every symplectic vector space $V$ is even dimensional, and in any such space, there is a pair of linearly independent sets $\{ e_i \}$ and $\{ f^i \}$, together forming a basis of $V$, such that $\omega(e_i,e_j) = \omega(f^i,f^j) = 0$, and $\omega(e_i,f^i) = 1$. A basis of the form above is called a \emph{Darboux basis}, and we conclude from it's existence that all symplectic vector spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic.

%The latter identification leads to some interesting structural properties. In particular, we conclude that  \emph{every} symplectic vector space $V$ can be (non-naturally) equipped with the structure of a vector space over the complex numbers, in a way compatible with the symplectic form on $V$, i.e. such that
%
%\[ \omega(iv, iv') = \omega(v,v') \]
%
%for any $v,v' \in V$. On $\CC^n$, we have a natural hermitian product, which we might write as
%
%\[ \beta(z,w) = z \cdot \overline{w} = \omega(iz,w) - i \omega(z, z'). \]
% \omega(-iz,w)
% - Im(-iz w^*)
% - omega(Jz,w)
% Re(zw^*)

Let $W$ be a subspace of a symplectic vector space $(V,\omega)$. The non-degeneracy of $\omega$ implies that $\dim(W) + \dim(W^\perp) = \dim(V)$ and $W^{\perp \perp} = W$. We say that:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $W$ is \emph{isotropic} if $W \subset W^\perp$.
    \item $W$ is \emph{coisotropic}, or \emph{involutive} if $W^\perp \subset W$.
    \item $W$ is \emph{Lagrangian} if $W = W^\perp$.
    \item $W$ is \emph{symplectic} if $W \cap W^\perp = \{ 0 \}$.
\end{itemize}
%
Note that if $\dim(V) = 2n$, then the equation above implies that isotropic subspaces have dimension at most $n$, coisotropic subspaces have dimension at least $n$, and Lagrangian subspaces must have dimension $n$.
%For any subspace $W$, $W / (W \cap W^\perp)$ is naturally given a symplectic structure inherited from $V$. In particular, if $W$ is isotropic, then $W/W^\perp$ is a symplectic vector space; if $W$ is coisotropic, then $W^\perp / W$ is symplectic. A dimensionality argument shows that $W$ is Lagrangian if and only if it is either isotropic or coisotropic, and $\dim(W) = \dim(V) / 2$.

\begin{example}
    Let $A: W \to W^*$ be a linear map. Then the graph $\Gamma(A)$ of $A$ forms a Lagrangian subspace of $W \oplus W^*$ if and only if $A$ is self-adjoint. Indeed, $\dim(\Gamma(A)) = \dim(W)$, and we have $W \subset W^\perp$ if and only if for all $w_1,w_2 \in W$,
    %
    \[ \langle Aw_2, w_1 \rangle - \langle w_2, Aw_1 \rangle = 0, \]
    %
    which implies $A$ is self-adjoint.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    For any $\theta \in \RR$, the space $e^{i \theta} \RR^n$ is a Lagrangian subspace of $\CC^n$. Indeed, we calculate that for any $x_1,x_2 \in \RR^n$,
    %
    \[ \omega(e^{i \theta} x_1, e^{i \theta} x_2) = - \text{Im} ( x_1 \cdot x_2 ) = 0. \]
    %
    The fact that $\dim(e^{i \theta} \RR^d) = n$ implies the subspace is Lagrangian.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
    If $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isotropic subspaces of a symplectic vector space $V$, and $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{ 0 \}$, then there exists two Lagrangian subspaces $L_1$ and $L_2$ of $V$, containing $W_1$ and $W_2$ respectively, such that $L_1 \cap L_2 = \{ 0 \}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $V$ be $2n$ dimensional. Consider a \emph{maximal} pair of isotropic subspaces $W_1^*$ and $W_2^*$, which are disjoint from one another, and contain $W_1$ and $W_2$ respectively. If one of these spaces is not Lagrangian, swapping the order of spaces if necessary, we may assume that $\dim(W_1^*) < n$. Find $x_0 \in [(W_1)^*]^{\perp \perp} - W_1^*$. Then $W_1 \oplus \RR x_0$ is also isotropic, which gives a contradiction.
\end{proof}

The following Lemma is a coordinatized version of the previous Lemma.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $V$ be a symplectic vector space, and let
    %
    \[ \{ e_1, \dots, e_{n_1} \} \cup \{ f^1, \dots, f^{n_2} \} \]
    %
    be linearly independent vectors such that $\omega(e_i,e_j) = \omega(f^i,f^j) = 0$, and $\omega(e_i,f^j) = \delta(i,j)$. Then we can extend these sets to a full Darboux basis for $V$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $W_1$ denote the linear space of $\{ e_1, \dots, e_{n_1} \}$, and let $W_2$ denote the space of $\{ f^1, \dots, f^{n_2} \}$. Then $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isotropic, and $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{ 0 \}$. We can therefore find transverse Lagrangian subspaces $L_1$ and $L_2$ with $W_1 \subset L_1$ and $W_2 \subset L_2$. By identifying $L_1$ with the dual of $L_2$, we can find $\{ e_{n_1 + 1}, \dots, e_n \}$, and $\{ f^{n_2}, \dots, f^n \}$, such that the two bases are dual to one another. This is the required Darboux basis.
%    Suppose first that $n_1 < n_2$. Since $\omega$ is non-degenerate, we can find a vector $e$ such that $\omega(e,e_i) = 0$ for $1 \leq i \leq n_1$, and $\omega(e,f^i) = \delta(i,n_1 + 1)$. It follows that $e$ is linearly independent from the previously selected elements of the basis and we can set $e_{n_1 + 1} = e$. Thus we can increase $n_1$ by one. A similar argument works for choosing $f_{n_2 + 1}$ if $n_2 < n_1$. If $n_1 = n_2$, and we don't yet have a basis, then we choose $e = e_{n_1 + 1}$ linearly independent to the previous set such that $\omega(e,e_i) = \omega(e,f^i) = 0$. Iterating this selection procedure yields the required Darboux basis.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    If $V_0$ and $V_1$ are Lagrangian subspaces of a symplectic vector space $V$, then we can find a third Lagrangian subspace $V_2$ which is transverse to both $V_0$ and $V_1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Define $W_1 = L_1$, and choose $W_2$ such that $L_2 = (L_1 \cap L_2) \oplus W_2$. Then $W_1$ and $W_2$ are disjoint, and isotropic, and so the previous Lemma implies we can find a Lagrangian subspace $L_2'$ containing $W_2$, and transverse to $L_1$. If we now identify $V$ with $\CC^n$, in such a way that $L_1 = \RR^n$, and $L_2' = i \RR^n$, then defining $L_3 = e^{i \pi / 4} L_2$ gives the required Lagrangian subspace.
%    Let $V$ have dimension $2n$. It suffices to find a Darboux basis in which
    %
%    \[ V_0 = \text{span}(e_1,\dots,e_n) \quad\text{and}\quad V_1 = \text{span}(e_1,\dots,e_k,f^{k+1},\dots,f^n), \]
    %
%    since we can then set $V_2$ to be the space spanned by $\{ e_i + f^i : k+1 \leq i \leq n \} \cup \{ f^1, \dots, f^k \}$. To do this, we pick $\{  e_1, \dots, e_n \}$ such that $\{ e_1, \dots, e_k \}$ spans $V_0 \cap V_1$, and $\{ e_1,\dots, e_n \}$ spans $V_1$. Next, we note that the map $T: V_0 \to \RR^{n-k}$ given by
    %
%    \[ Tv = (\omega(e_{k+1},v), \dots, \omega(e_n,v)) \]
    %
%    has kernel equal to $V_0 \cap V_1$. This is because $V_0^\perp = V_0$, so if $v \in V_1$, then we automatically obtain that $\omega(e_1,v) = \dots = \omega(e_k,v) = 0$, so that if $Tv = 0$, then $v \in V_0^\perp = V_0$. But this means that $T$ is surjective, so we can find $\{ f^{k+1},\dots,f^n \} \subset V_1$ such that $\omega(e_i,f_j) = \delta(i,j)$. It follows that $\{ e_1,\dots,e_k \} \cup \{ f^{k+1},\dots,f^n \}$ are linearly independent, and thus form a basis for $V_1$. And we can now use the previous Lemma to extend these vectors to a Darboux basis.
\end{proof}

\section{Symplectic Maps}

A linear map $T: V \to W$ between two symplectic vector spaces is called \emph{symplectic} if it preserves the symplectic form on $V$. We will denote the set of all symplectic isomorphisms (symplectomorphisms) by $\text{Sp}(V)$, and we call this set the \emph{symplectic group}. If $\dim(V) = 2n$, then the group is a connected, non-compact Lie group of dimension $2n^2 + n$. The symplectic group $\text{Sp}(\RR^{2n})$ is denoted by $\text{Sp}(n)$, and can be identified with the family of $2n \times 2n$ matrices which satisfy $M^t \Omega M = \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the $2n \times 2n$ matrix
%
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & +I \\ -I & 0 \end{pmatrix}. \]
%
We note that $\Omega^2 = - I$.

Given any linear transformation $T: V \to W$ between two symplectic vector spaces, we can define a symplectic-adjoint $T^\dag: W \to V$ by the equation
%
\[ \omega(Tv,w) = \omega(v, T^\dag w). \]
%
A symplectomorphism is then precisely a map $T$ such that $T^\dag = T^{-1}$. On $\RR^{2n}$, we calculate that

\[ \omega(Tv, w) = v^t T^t \Omega w = v^t \Omega (- \Omega T^t \Omega w) = \omega(v, - \Omega T^t \Omega w), \]
%
and thus $T^\dag = - \Omega T^t \Omega$. Since $\det(\Omega) = 1$, we conclude that $\det(T^\dag) = \det(T)$ for any linear endomorphism $T: V \to V$. In particular, if $T$ is a symplectomorphism, then $T^\dag = T^{-1}$, and thus $\det(T) = \pm 1$. In particular, if we write
%
\[ T = \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix} \]
%
for $n \times n$ square matrices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, then
%
\[ T^\dag = \begin{pmatrix} +D^t & -B^t \\ - C^t & + A^t \end{pmatrix}. \]
%
Thus $T$ is symplectic precisely when $A^t D - B^t C = I$, and that $A^tC$, $D^t B$, $B^t A$, and $C^t D$ are all symmetric matrices. If $T$ is within a neighborhood of the identity, then we can write $B = S^t A^{-1}$ and $C = (A^t)^{-1} L$ for two symmetric matrices $S$ and $T$, and then $D = A^{-1}(I - (A^t)^{-1} ST A^{-1})$. Thus symplectic matrices in a neighborhood of the identity can be expressed uniquely as a matrix $A \in GL(n)$, and two symmetric matrices $S$ and $L$, each having $n(n+1)/2$ independent coordinates. This immediately tells us the dimension of $\text{Sp}(n)$, i.e. $2n^2 + n$.

Now consider a symplectic matrix $M$. Noting that
%
\[ \Omega M = (M^t)^{-1} \Omega \quad\text{and}\quad \Omega M^t = M^{-1} \Omega, \]
%
we calculate that
%
\[ (M^t M) \Omega (M^t M) = M^t M M^{-1} (M^t)^{-1} \Omega = \Omega. \]
%
If we set $P = (M^t M)^{1/2}$, then we conclude that for all $k$,
%
\[ P^{2k} \Omega P^{2k} = \Omega. \]
%
But, taking power series, this means that for \emph{any} analytic function $f$ defined in a neighborhood of $\sigma(P) \subset (0,\infty)$,
%
\[ f(P^2) \Omega f(P^2) = \Omega. \]
%
But taking $f(t) = t^{\tau / 2}$ gives that
%
\[ P^\tau \Omega P^\tau = \Omega. \]
%
Since $P$ is positive definite, we can write $P = e^L$ for some symmetric matrix $L$. But then plugging this into the equation above, and differentiating in $\tau$ as $\tau \to 0$ yields that $L \Omega + \Omega L = 0$. Applying the polar decomposition theorem, there exists a unique unitary matrix $U$ such that $M = PU$. The formula above for $\tau = 1$ implies that $P$ is symplectic, and since $\text{Sp}(n)$ is a group, $U$ is also symplectic and unitary. Now since $L \Omega + \Omega L = 0$, we can write
%
\[ L = \begin{pmatrix} +A & B \\ B & -A \end{pmatrix}, \]
%
where $A$ and $B$ are symmetric. But
%
\[ \begin{pmatrix} +A & B \\ B & -A \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} A & -B \\ +B & A \end{pmatrix} \cdot \Omega. \]
%
The matrix $S$ on the right hand side is a \emph{complex} linear symmetric matrix, if we identify $\RR^{2n}$ with $\CC^n$. Thus we conclude that we can write \emph{any} element of $\text{Sp}(n)$ uniquely as $e^{S \Omega} U$, where $U$ is a unitary transformation on $\CC^{n}$, and $S$ is a complex linear symmetric map on $\CC^n$. In particular, we conclude that $\text{SP}(n)$ is diffeomorphic to $\CC^{n(n+1)/2} \times U(n)$.

\section{Linear Canonical Relations}

If $V_X$ and $V_Y$ are symplectic vector spaces, then $V_X \oplus V_Y$ can be made into a symplectic vector space, if we equip it either with with the symplectic form $\omega_X - \omega_Y$, or with $\omega_Y - \omega_X$. In either case, we call a Lagrangian subspace $C$ of $V_X \oplus V_Y$ a \emph{linear canonical relation}. We recall that a \emph{symplectic linear map} $A: V_1 \to V_2$ between symplectic vector spaces is a map preserving the symplectic form.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $C \subset V_X \oplus V_Y$ be a linear canonical relation. Then we can find orthogonal decompositions $V_X = V_{X,1} \oplus V_{X,2}$ and $V_Y = V_{Y,1} \oplus V_{Y,2}$ such that
    %
    \[ C = C_X \oplus \Gamma \oplus C_Y, \]
    %
    where $C_X$ is a Lagrangian submanifold of $V_{X,1}$, $C_Y$ is a Lagrangian submanifold of $V_{Y,1}$, and $\Gamma$ is the graph of a symplectic isomorphism $A: V_{X,2} \to V_{Y,2}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let
    %
    \[ C_X = \{ x \in V_X : (x,0) \in C \} \quad\text{and}\quad C_Y = \{ y \in V_Y : (0,y) \in C \}. \]
    %
    Because $C$ is Lagrangian, $C$ is contained in $C_X^\perp \oplus C_Y^\perp$. In other words, if $x_1 \in C_X$, $y_1 \in C_Y$, and $(x_2,y_2) \in C$, then
    %
    \[ \omega(x_1,x_2) = \omega(y_1,y_2) = 0. \]
    %
    In particular, $C_X \subset C_X^\perp$ and $C_Y \subset C_Y^\perp$. Find orthogonal $V_{X,2}$ and $V_{Y,2}$ such that
    %
    \[ C_X^\perp = C_X \oplus V_{X,2} \quad\text{and}\quad C_Y^\perp = C_Y \oplus V_{Y,2}. \]
    %
    Then $C \subset C_X \oplus C_Y \oplus (V_{X,2} \oplus V_{Y,2})$. We can thus find $\Gamma \subset V_{X,2} \oplus V_{Y,2}$ such that $C = C_X \oplus C_Y \oplus \Gamma$. We claim $\Gamma$ projects bijectively onto $V_{X,2}$ and $V_{Y,2}$. For instance, suppose $x \in V_{X,2}$ and $y_1,y_2 \in V_{Y,2}$ are such that $(x,y_1)$ and $(x,y_2)$ lie in $\Gamma$. Then $(0,y_1 - y_2)$ lies on $\Gamma$ and on $C_Y$, so by orthogonality, $y_1 = y_2$. Thus $\Gamma$ is the graph of a symplectic isomorphism $A:V_{X,2} \to V_{Y,2}$. To define $V_{X,1}$ and $V_{Y,1}$, let
    %
    \[ \dim(V_X) = 2n \quad \dim(V_Y) = 2m \quad \dim(C_X) = a \quad \dim(C_Y) = b. \]
    %
    We can then consider Darboux bases
    %
    \[ \{ e_{X,1}, \dots, e_{X,n} \} \cup \{ f_{X,1}, \dots, f_{X,m} \} \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ \{ e_{Y,1}, \dots, e_{Y,m} \} \cup \{ f_{Y,1}, \dots, f_{Y,m} \} \]
    %
    for $V_X$ and $V_Y$, such that
    %
    \[ C_X = \text{span} ( \{ e_{X,1}, \dots, e_{X,a} \} ) \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ C_Y = \text{span} ( \{ e_{Y,1}, \dots, e_{Y,b} \} ). \]
    %
    But then we immediately see that
    %
    \[ V_{X,2} = \text{span}( \{ e_{X,a+1}, \dots, e_{X,n} \} \cup \{ f_{X,a+1}, \dots, f_{X,n} \} ) \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ V_{Y,2} = \text{span}( \{ e_{Y,b+1}, \dots, e_{Y,m} \} \cup \{ f_{Y,a+1}, \dots, f_{Y,m} \} ). \]
    %
    We then simply define
    %
    \[ V_{X,1} = \text{span}( \{ f_{X,1}, \dots, f_{X,a} \}  ) \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ V_{Y,1} = \text{span}( \{ f_{Y,1}, \dots, f_{Y,b} \} ), \]
    %
    and the remaining parts of the proof follow immediately.
\end{proof}

\section{Symplectic Manifolds}

A \emph{symplectic manifold} $M$ is a manifold equipped with a symplectic form $\omega$, i.e. a closed two form which gives each of the tangent spaces of $M$ a symplectic structure. The basic example here is $M = T^* X$, where $X$ is any smooth manifold; the natural two form here is
%
\[ \omega = dx \wedge d\xi = d \theta, \]
%
where $\theta = \sum \xi_i dx^i$ is the \emph{tautological one form} on $T^* M$. It has the property that for any section $s: M \to T^* M$, we have $s^* \theta = s$.

\begin{example}
    For a manifold $M$, the main example of a symplectic manifold, for our purposes, will be the manifold $T^* M$, which is equipped with a two form $\omega$ given by identifying $T(T^* M)$ with $TM \oplus T^*M$, i.e. in coordinates $(x,\xi)$ for $T^* M$, induced from a coordinate system $x$ on $M$, we have
    %
    \[ \omega = \sum d\xi_i \wedge dx^i. \]
    %
    The form is closed, because it is exact, i.e. $\omega = d \theta$, where $\theta = \sum \xi_i dx^i$ is the \emph{fundamental symplectic one form}.
\end{example}

Like with the Riemannian form on a Riemannian manifold, the symplectic form on a symplectic manifold gives a natural bundle isomorphism $J: T^*M \to TM$. In particular, given a function $H : M \to \RR$, we can define the \emph{symplectic gradient} $\nabla_{\Xi} H$ as the vector field which is identified under the bundle isomorphism with the covector field $dH$. As an example, if $M = T^* X$, then in local coordinates $(x,\xi)$ on $T^* X$, the identification is given by
%
\[ J(d\xi^i) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \quad\text{and}\quad J \left( dx^i \right) = - \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^i}. \]
%
Thus for a function $H: T^* X \to \RR$, we have
%
\[ \nabla_{\Xi} H = \sum \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi^i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x^i} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^i}. \]
%
Often this gradient is often just denoted by $X_H$. This gradient is closely related to the theory of Hamiltonian vector fields, i.e. since, given a Hamiltonian $H$ on some phase space representing a physical system, $X_H$ gives the Hamiltonian flow of that physical system. We can define the \emph{Poisson bracket} of two functions $H: M \to \RR$ and $I: M \to \RR$ by setting
%
\[ \{ H, I \} = \nabla_\Xi H (I) = \omega(dH, dI) = [X_H, X_I]. \]
%
For $M = T^* X$, we can write this in coordinates as
%
\[ \{ H, I \} = \sum \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi_i} \frac{\partial I}{\partial x_i} - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial I}{\partial \xi_i}, \]
%
which agrees with the classical Poisson bracket. Equipped with the Poisson bracket, the space $C^\infty(M)$ becomes a Lie algebra. We have an exact sequence
%
\[ 0 \to H^0(M) \to C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{H}(M) \to 0, \]
%
where $\mathbb{H}(M)$ is the space of all \emph{Hamiltonian vector fields} on $M$, i.e. because $\nabla_\Xi f = 0$ if and only if $df = 0$, which implies that $f$ lies in $H^0(M)$.

A \emph{symplectic} map $F: M_1 \to M_2$ between two symplectic manifolds $(M_1,\omega_1)$ and $(M_2,\omega_2)$ is one which preserves the symplectic form on tangent spaces, i.e. such that $F^* \omega_2 = \omega_1$. A \emph{Darboux chart} on an open set $U$ is a symplectic diffeomorphism $U \to \RR^{2n}$. The coordinates $\{ e_i \} \cup \{ f^j \}$ are called \emph{Darboux coordinates} on the manifold.We shall prove that Darboux charts cover any symplectic manifold. Thus local symplectic geometry differs drastically from local Riemannian geometry; any two symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally symplectomorphic, whereas that is certainly not true of two Riemannian manifolds. We will actually now prove a stronger extension result, due to A. Weinstein.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a $C^\infty$ manifold, $Y$ a closed submanifold, and let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two symplectic forms on $X$, which agree on the tangent spaces of $Y$. Then there exists two open neighborhoods $U_1$ and $U_2$ of $Y$ and a symplectomorphism $\Phi: (U_1,\omega_1) \to (U_2,\omega_2)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The form $\omega_2 - \omega_1$ vanishes on $Y$. Thus we can find a tubular neighborhood $U$ of $Y$, and a one-form $\alpha$ on $U_1$, such that $d\alpha = \omega_2 - \omega_1$, and such that both $\alpha$ and it's first derivatives vanish on $Y$. Set
    %
    \[ \omega_t = \omega_0 + t(\omega_1 - \omega_0). \]
    %
    Then $\omega_t$ is skew-symmetric, but not necessarily non-degenerate for all $t$. But we can make it so by shrinking the tubular neighborhood $U_1$, since $\omega_1 - \omega_0$ vanishes on $U_1$. Now let $X_t$ be the vector field identified under $\omega_t$ with $\alpha$. Let us integrate this vector field, constructing maps $\{ \phi_t(s) \}$ such that
    %
    \[ \frac{d\phi_t}{ds} = X_t \circ \phi_t. \]
    %
    Set $\Phi_t(x) = \phi_t(x,t)$. Note that $X_t$, and it's first derivatives, all vanish on $Y$. It follows that, thinning $U_1$ again, we may assume that $U_1$ is mapped diffeomorphically into itself by $\Phi_t$ for all $t \in [0,1]$. Let $U_2$ be the image of $U_1$ under $\Phi_1$. We claim that
    %
    \[ \Phi_t^*(\omega_t) = \omega_0. \]
    %
    Indeed, the product rule implies that
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \{ \Phi_t^*(\omega_t) \} = \Phi_t^* \left\{ \frac{d\omega_t}{dt} + L_{X_t}(\omega_t) \right\}. \]
    %
    But Cartan's formula implies that, since $d\omega_t = 0$,
    %
    \[ L_{X_t}(\omega_t) = i_{X_t} d\omega_t + d(i_{X_t} \omega_t) = d(i_{X_t} \omega_t), \]
    %
    and $i_{X_t} \omega_t(Y) = \omega_t(X_t,Y) = \alpha(Y)$, so $i_{X_t} \omega_t = \alpha$. But this means that
    %
    \[ L_{X_t} \omega_t = d \alpha, \]
    %
    and so since $d\omega_t / dt = \omega_1 - \omega_0$,
    %
    \[ \Phi_t^* \left\{ \frac{d\omega_t}{dt} + L_{X_t}(\omega_t) \right\} = \Phi_t^* \left\{ (\omega_1 - \omega_0) + d \alpha \right\} = \Phi_t^*(0) = 0. \]
    %
    Thus we conclude that $\Phi_t^*(\omega_t)$ is constant, and thus equal to $\omega_0$ since $\Phi_0$ is the identity. But this means that $\Phi_1^*(\omega_1) = \omega_0$, which verifies the claim.
\end{proof}

We also have an extension theorem for Darboux coordinates.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a manifold, fix $x \in X$, and a neighborhood $U$ containing $x$, and let $\{ e_1,\dots,e_r \}$ and $\{ f^1,\dots,f^s \}$ be $C^\infty$ functions defined in a neighborhood of $x$, such that $x$ lies on the common zero set of all these functions, the differentials $\{ de_i \} \cup \{ df^j \}$ are linearly independent at $x$, and we have the Poisson bracket relations
    %
    \[ \{ e_i, f^j \} = 0, \quad \{ e_i, e_j \} = \delta_{ij}, \quad\text{and}\quad \{ f^i, f^j \} = \delta_{ij} \]
    %
    on a neighborhood of $x$. Then these functions extend to a full Darboux coordinate system on a neighborhood of $x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Shrink $U$ small enough that it is contained in a coordinate system extending the functions $\{ e_i \} \cup \{ f^j \}$. Let $\{ x_{s+1}, \dots, x_n \} \cup \{ y_{r+1}, \dots, y_n \}$ denote the extra coordinates needed to form this coordinate system. Suppose first that $r < s$. For any manifold $M$ which is transverse to the vector fields $\{ \nabla_\Xi e_i \} \cup \{ \nabla_\Xi f_j \}$, by the Frobenius integrability theorem, we can foliate the manifold locally by manifolds upon which the functions $\{ e_i \}$ and $\{ f^j \}$ are constant. In particular, this implies we can guarantee the existence of a smooth function $u$ such that on $M$, $u$ agrees with $x_{r+1}$ on $M$, but satisfies $X_{e_i} u = \{ e_i, u \} = 0$ for $1 \leq i \leq r$, and $X_{f_j} u = \{ f_j, u \} = 0$ for $1 \leq j \leq s$, \emph{except} for $j = r+1$, in which case $X_{f_{r+1}} u = \{ f_{r+1}, u \} = -1$. Set $e_{r+1} = u$. Then the Darboux basis equations continue to hold on this extension. Iterating this procedure if necessary, swapping $\{ e_i \}$ and $\{ f^j \}$, we may assume that $r = s$. But then the common zero set of these functions forms a symplectic manifold, and so we may take a Darboux coordinate system on this symplectic manifold, which together form a Darboux coordinate system for the whole manifold.
\end{proof}

The $2n$-form on $X$ given by
%
\[ V = \frac{(-1)^{[n/2]}}{n!} \omega \wedge \dots \wedge \omega \]
%
is called the \emph{canonical volume}, or \emph{Pfaffian} on $X$. In symplectic coordinates, we have
%
\[ V = de^1 \wedge \dots \wedge de^n \wedge df_1 \wedge \dots \wedge df_n, \]
%
The canonical volume is certainly invariant under symplectomorphisms, including the flow of Hamiltonian vector fields. We can pullback this form to get a volume form on any submanifold of $X$. In particular, if $Y$ is symplectic, this is just the Pfaffian on $Y$. Since $V$ is non-vanishing, we conclude that \emph{any symplectic manifold is orientable}.

The concepts of \emph{isotropic}, \emph{coisotropic}, \emph{Lagrangian}, and \emph{symplectic} submanifolds are analogous to the linear concepts introduced at the beginning of the chapter (i.e. a submanifold such that the tangent space at each point fits these properties).

Given a symplectic manifold $(X^{2n},\omega)$, we often specify a submanifold $Y$ of $X$ by fixing $m$ functions $H_1,\dots,H_m$, such that the differentials $dH_1,\dots,dH_m$ are linearly independent on their common zero set $Z(H_1,\dots,H_m)$. Then
%
\[ Y = \{ x: H_1(x) = \dots = H_m(x) = 0 \}. \]
%
is a submanifold of $X$ with codimension $m$. Moreover, every submanifold of codimension $m$ can be given locally in this form. We are interested on conditions on the functions $\{ H_1,\dots, H_m \}$ which guarantee that $Y$ fits the properties above.

\begin{theorem}
    The manifold $Y$ is a symplectic submanifold if and only if the $m \times m$ matrix with coefficients given by the Poisson bracket $\{ H_i, H_j \}$ is nonsingular.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The manifold $Y$ is a symplectic submanifold if and only if $\omega$, restricted to $Y$, is nondegenerate. For each $y_0 \in Y$, the set of values orthogonal to the space $T_{y_0} Y$, viewed as a subspace of $T_{y_0} X$, and with respect to the bilinear form $\omega$, is \emph{precisely} the family of Hamiltonian vector fields $\{ \nabla_\Xi H_j \}$. The space $T_{y_0} Y$ is symplectic if and only if the vector space spanned by $\{ \nabla_\Xi H_j \}$ is symplectic, and this holds precisely when the matrix with coefficients given by the Poisson brackets $\{ H_i, H_j \}$ form an invertible matrix (so that the form $\omega$ is nondegenerate here).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The result above can thus only hold if $m$ is even. Given the assumption that $Y$ is symplectic, let $\dim(Y) = 2r$. The nonsingularity property above implies that if $Y$ is symplectic, then we can find smooth functions $\{ a_{ij} : 1 \leq i \leq r \}$ and $\{ b_{ij} : 1 \leq i \leq r \}$ such that if we set
    %
    \[ e_i = \sum a_{ij} H_j \quad\text{and}\quad f^i = \sum b_{ij} H_j, \]
    %
    then $\{ e_i \}$ and $\{ f^i \}$ form a partial Darboux coordinate system. If we extend this to a full Darboux coordinate system, the remaining coordinates would form a Darboux coordinate system on $Y$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    If $H,I \in C^\infty(X)$ and $\{ H, I \} \neq 0$ on the zero set $Z(H,I)$, then $Z(H,I)$ is a symplectic manifold of codimension two.
\end{example}

Next, we move on to the problem of determining when $Y$ is coisotropic.

\begin{theorem}
    The manifold $Y$ is coisotropic if and only if $\{ H_j, H_k \} = 0$ on $Y$, for all $j$ and $k$. It then follows that we can find functions $\{ c_{jkl} \}$ in $C^\infty(Y)$ such that, on $Y$,
    %
    \[ [ \nabla_\Xi H_j, \nabla_\Xi H_k ] = \sum c_{jkl} \nabla_\Xi H_l, \]
    %
    i.e. so the distribution defined locally by the functions $\{ H_j \}$ and $\{ H_k \}$ is integrable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Fix $y_0 \in Y$. If $T_{y_0} Y$ is an coisotropic subspace of $T_{y_0} X$, then it's orthogonal complement $V_{y_0}$ with respect to $\omega$ is an isotropic subspace of $T_{y_0} X$. This orthogonal complement is spanned by the vectors $(\nabla_\Xi H_j)(y_0)$, and thus this space is isotropic if and only if
    %
    \[ \omega(\nabla_\Xi H_j(y_0), \nabla_\Xi H_k(y_0)) = \{ H_j, H_k \}(y_0) = 0. \]
    %
    This proves the first part of the claim. The second part follows immediately from a calculation.
\end{proof}

Suppose $Y$ is coisotropic, and $2n - m$ dimensional for some $m \leq n$. The theorem above implies that the $m$ dimensional bundle $(TY)^\perp$ is an integrable distribution on $Y$, so we can use the Frobenius theorem to foliate $Y$ by $m$ dimensional submanifolds with $(TY)^\perp$ as their tangent spaces. These manifolds are called the \emph{characteristics} of $Y$, and each is a isotropic submanifold of $X$, because $(TY)^\perp$ is contained in $(TY)^{\perp \perp} = TY$.

\begin{example}
    If $H \in C^\infty(X)$, and $dH$ is non-vanishing on $Z(H)$, then $Z(H)$ is coisotropic, and it's characteristics are precisely the integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$.
\end{example}

It is often the case that the family $Y_0$ of characteristics of $Y$ can be given the structure of a smooth $2(n-m)$ dimensional manifold, such that the projection map $Y \to Y_0$ is a submersion. This is at least the case locally. It then follows that this projection induces a bijection of $TY / (TY)^\perp$ with $TY_0$, and (since $TY / (TY)^\perp$ is symplectic), this means that $Y_0$ is naturally a symplectic manifold.

\begin{theorem}
    A submanifold $Y$ of $X$ is coisotropic if and only if every point $y_0 \in Y$ is contained in a Lagrangian submanifold of $X$, which is also a submanifold of $Y$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $Y$ is coisotropic. Consider the class $Y_0$ of characteristics of $Y$. Locally at least, we can consider $Y_0$ as a symplectic manifold. Given any $y_0 \in Y$, and let $L_0$ be a Lagrangian submanifold of $Y_0$ containing the characteristic of $Y$ passing through $y_0$. Because the projection $Y \to Y_0$ is symplectic, the collection of points in $L_0$ forms an isotropic submanifold of $X$. But this collection of points is $n$ dimensional, and thus a Lagrangian submanifold of $X$. Conversely, if this property holds, then $Y$ is a union of Lagrangian submanifolds of $X$. But if $L$ is a Lagrangian submanifold of $Y$, then
    %
    \[ (TY)^\perp \subset (TL)^\perp = TL, \]
    %
    and so $(TY)^\perp \subset TY$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $Y$ is an $m$ dimensional isotropic submanifold of $X$. Then at every point $y_0 \in Y$, we can write $Y$ locally as the intersection of a $2m$ dimensional symplectic submanifold of $X$, and a Lagrangian submanifold of $X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Fix $y_0 \in Y$. Let $S$ be any smooth submanifold, containing $Y$ in a neighborhood of $y_0$, and such that $T_{y_0} S$ is symplectic. We then know that $S$ is symplectic in a neighborhood of $y_0$. Then $Y$ is a Lagrangian submanifold of $S$. By working in a Darboux coordinate system for $S$, extended to a Darboux coordinate system for $X$, we can find another symplectic manifold $S'$ transverse to $S$. Taking a Lagrangian submanifold of $S'$ containing $Y$ yields the claim.
\end{proof}

A Lagrangian submanifold $Y$ of $X^{2n}$ is clearly just an $n$ dimensional isotropic (or coisotropic) manifold. One simple way to check that the submanifold is Lagrangian is to check that $i^* \omega = 0$, where $i: Y \to X$ is the inclusion map.

\begin{example}
    Let $M'$ be a smooth, $k$ dimensional submanifold of an $n$ dimensional manifold $M$. We define it's \emph{conormal bundle}, $N^* M'$, to be the the set of all cotangent vectors $(x,\xi)$ in $T^* M$, with $x \in M'$ and such that $\xi$ vanishes when restricted to $M'$. If we work locally in coordinates in which $M'$ is a plane, then we immediately see that $M'$ is Lagrangian.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Most Lagrangian manifolds will arise from our study of oscillatory integrals in the following way. Let $\phi: M^d \times \RR^N_\theta \to \RR$ be a \emph{non-degenerate phase function}, i.e. a smooth function homogeneous in the $\theta$ variable, and such that whenever $\nabla_\theta \phi = 0$, the $N$ covectors $d_{x,\theta}(\partial_\theta^1 \phi), \dots, d_{x,\theta}(\partial_\theta^N \phi)$ are linearly independent. It then follows that the set
    %
    \[ \Sigma_\phi = \{ (x,\theta): \nabla_\theta \phi = 0 \} \]
    %
    is a conic $d$-dimensional submanifold of $M \times \RR^N$, and the map $\Sigma_\phi \to T^* M$ given by $F(x,\theta) \mapsto (x, d_x \phi)$ is an immersion. The image is an (immersed) Lagrangian submanifold of $T^* M$. To see this, we note that $F^*(\theta) = d_x\phi$; since $d_\theta \phi = 0$ when restricted to $\Sigma_\phi$, we conclude that, on $\Sigma_\phi$, $d_x \phi = d_x \phi + d_\theta \phi = d_{x,\theta} \phi$ on $\Sigma_\phi$. But this means that $d(d_x \phi) = 0$, which is sufficient to show that $F^*(d \omega) = d(F^* \theta) = d(d_x \phi) = 0$.
\end{example}

\section{Existence of Phase Functions}

We now specialize to the study of the symplectic manifold $T^*M$.

\begin{theorem}
    Fix smooth functions $p_1,\dots,p_m$ on $T^* M$, and suppose that the differentials $d_\xi p_1$,$\dots$,$d_\xi p_m$ are linearly independent on the set $Y = Z(p_1,\dots,p_m)$, i.e. so that $Y$ is a submanifold of $M$ with codimension $m$. Then $Y$ is coisotropic if and only if locally, around each point $(x_0,\xi^0)$ in $Y$, we can find an open set $U$ of $x_0$ in $M$, and a real-valued smooth function $\phi$ defined on $U$ such that $p_i(d \phi(x)) = 0$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$, and $d\phi(x_0) = \xi^0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The condition implies $Y$ is coisotropic. Indeed, the graph $d \phi: M \to T^* M$ is an immersed Lagrangian submanifold of $T^* M$. It is contained in $Y$ by assumption, and passes through $(x_0,\xi^0)$. But we then know that $Y$ is coisotropic, since it is a union of Lagrangian manifolds.

    Conversely, we suppose $Y$ is coisotropic. Then we can foliate $Y$ by it's $m$ dimensional characteristic submanifolds, each an isotropic submanifold of $X$. Suppose we can find an $n - m$ dimensional isotropic submanifold $L_0$ of $Y$, which is transverse to all these characteristics of $Y$. Then the union of all characteristics passing through $L_0$ forms an isotropic submanifold $L$ of $Y$ of dimension $n$, which is thus Lagrangian. We will pick $L$ to be the graph of a function $x \mapsto a(x)$, chosen in such a way that the projection of the fundamental form $\theta$ on $L$ onto $M$ induces a closed form which we can locally write as $d\phi$, where $\phi$ is the function we are required to construct.

    Given the assumption that the differentials $d_\xi p_1, \dots, d_\xi p_m$ are linearly independent, we can (possibly after reordering coordinates), locally write
    %
    \[ Y = \{ (x,\xi): \xi'' = f_j(x,\xi') \}, \]
    %
    where $\xi = (\xi', \xi'')$, for $\xi' \in \RR^{n-m}$ and $\xi'' \in \RR^m$, and $f = (f_{n-m+1},\dots,f_n)$. Consider the codimension $m$ hyperplane
    %
    \[ \Sigma = \{ x : x'' = x_0'' \}. \]
    %
    Let $H_j = \xi_j - f_j(x, (\xi^0)')$, for $n-m < j \leq n$. Because the functions $\{ dp_j(y) \}$ span the same subspace of $T^* M$ as $\{ dH_j(y) \}$ for $y \in Y$, we conclude that $\{ \nabla_\Xi p_j(y) \}$ spans the same subspace of $TM$ as $\{ \nabla_\Xi H_j(y) \}$. But
    %
    \[ \nabla_\Xi H_j = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} + \sum_k \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^k} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^k}, \]
    %
    and the projection of this vector is transverse to $\Sigma$, which is spanned by $\partial / \partial x^j$ for $1 \leq j \leq n-m$. Thus the projection of the vectors $\nabla_\Xi p_j$ are also transverse to $\Sigma$.

    Define a function $\psi: \Sigma \to \RR$, such that for $1 \leq j \leq n-m$,
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x^j} = \xi^0_j. \]
    %
    Then define a function $a = (a',a'')$ on $\Sigma$, such that $a' = (a_1,\dots,a_{n-m})$ is defined by the equations
    %
    \[ a_j(x) = \partial \psi / \partial x^j \]
    %
    for $1 \leq j \leq n-m$, and $a'' = (a_{n-m+1}, \dots, a_n)$ is defined by
    %
    \[ a_j(x) = f_j(x,a'(x)). \]
    %
    The map $x \mapsto (x,a(x))$ is then a submanifold $L$ of $Y$, of dimension $n-m$ containing $(x_0,\xi^0)$. The submanifold $L_0$ is transverse to the characteristics of $Y$, precisely because the projections of $\nabla_\Xi p_j(y)$ are transverse to $\Sigma$. As discussed above, the union of characteristics passing through $L_0$ is then a Lagrangian manifold $L$. Taking the derivative of the projection $Y \to M$ induces a bijection of $TL_0$ with $T\Sigma$, and maps $TY^\perp$ onto a subspace transverse to $T\Sigma$. But then counting dimensions implies that the projection map $L \to M$ is a local diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of $(x_0,\xi^0)$. The inverse map $M \to L$ allows us to extend the function $a$ to be defined away from $\Sigma$.

    If $\pi: L \to M$ is a projection map, and $\alpha = \sum a_j(x) dx^j$, then
    %
    \[ \pi^* \alpha = \sum \xi_j dx^j = \theta \]
    %
    is the fundamental form. Since $L$ is Lagrangian, $\theta$ is closed on $L$, and thus $\alpha$ is closed in $M$. The restriction of $\alpha$ to $\Sigma$ is exact, and thus we conclude that there is a neighborhood of $\Sigma$ upon which $\alpha$ is exact, i.e. we can find a function $\phi$ on $M$ such that $\alpha = d\phi$. But this means precisely that we have found a function $\phi$ such that for $1 \leq j \leq n$,
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^j} = a_j(x). \]
    %
    In particular, this means that $p_i(d \phi(x)) = 0$. And $\phi$ equals $\psi$ on $\Sigma$, so in particular, this means that $d\phi(x_0) = \xi^0$.
\end{proof}



We will later see \emph{all} conic Lagrangian manifolds are locally of the form above.

\begin{example}
    If $\phi: M \to \RR$ is a smooth function, then $d\phi: M \to T^* M$ is an immersed Lagrangian submanifold of $T^* M$, since
    %
    \[ (d\phi)^*(\theta) = \sum \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^i} dx^i = d\phi, \]
    %
    is closed, and thus
    %
    \[ (d\phi^*)(\omega) = (d\phi)^*(d \theta) = d(d(\phi)^* \theta) = d^2 \phi = 0. \]
    %
    The next lemma shows that all Lagrangian sections are locally of this form.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
    The image of a section $s: X \to T^* X$ is an immersed Lagrangian submanifold if and only if locally we can write
    %
    \[ s = d f \]
    %
    for some function $f: X \to \RR$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    If $\theta = \sum \xi^i dx^i$, then $d\theta$ is the symplectic form $\omega$, and $s^* \theta = s$. Thus $s$ gives a Lagrangian manifold if and only if $s^* \omega = s^*(d \theta) = d(s^* \theta) = ds = 0$. The result above now follows by Poincar\'{e}'s Lemma.
\end{proof}

A similar result holds if $\Lambda$ is a conic Lagrangian submanifold of $T^* X$.

\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that $\Lambda \subset T^* X - \{ 0_X \}$ is a conic Lagrangian manifold containing some covector $(x_0,\xi_0) \in T^* X$. Then local coordinates $(x,U)$ can be chosen, centered at $x_0$, inducing coordinates $(x,\xi)$ on $T^* U$, such that the map $(x,\xi) \mapsto \xi$ is a diffeomorphism in an open neighborhood of $(x_0,\xi_0)$ in $\Lambda$, and there exists a smooth, homogeneous function $H$ such that, in a small neighborhood of $(x_0,\xi_0)$ in $T^* X$, $\Lambda$ locally agrees with set of points  $\{ (\nabla H(\xi), \xi) \}$ in the coordinate system.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We first choose coordinates $(x,U)$ such that $(x,\xi) \mapsto \xi$ is a diffeomorphism. Begin by choosing coordinates $(y,V)$ centered at $x_0$ such that $\nu = dy_1$. The tangent plane $V_0$ to $\Lambda$ at $\nu$ must be Lagrangian. If $V_0$ is transverse to the Lagrangian plane given in $(y,\eta)$ coordinates by
    %
    \[ V_1 = \{ (0,a) : a \in \RR^d \}, \]
    %
    then we can set $x$ to be $y$. Otherwise, we find $V_2$ Lagrangian and transverse to both $V_0$ and $V_1$. Since $V_2$ is transverse to $V_1$, it can be identified with a linear section, and the last result thus implies that we can find a quadratic form $Q: \RR^d \to \RR^d$ such that 
    %
    \[ V_2 = \{ (a,dQ(a)) : a \in \RR^d \}. \]
    %
    If we set $x_1 = y_1 + Q(y)$, and $x_i = y_i$ for $2 \leq i \leq n$, then these are the required coordinates.

    We claim now that if $(x,U)$ gives a diffeomorphism, then we can find $H$. Shrinking $U$ if necessary, there exists a radial $\phi: \RR^d \to U$ such that
    %
    \[ \Lambda \cap U = \{ (\phi(\xi), \xi) : \xi \in \RR^d \}. \]
    %
    Since $\Lambda$ is Lagrangian, if $\psi(\xi) = (\phi(\xi),\xi)$, then
    %
    \[ \psi^* \theta = \sum \xi_i d\phi_i = 0. \]
    %
    If we set $H(\xi) = \sum \xi_i \phi_i(\xi)$, then $\nabla H = \phi$, giving the required result.
\end{proof}

The structure of linear canonical relations can give us results about `nonlinear' canonical relations, i.e. a conic Lagrangian submanifold of $T^* X \times T^* Y$ for two manifolds $X^n$ and $Y^m$.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be smooth manifolds, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a conic Lagrangian submanifold of $T^* X \times T^* Y$. Fix $(x_0,y_0;\xi_0,\eta_0) \in \mathcal{C}$, and assume that the vector
    %
    \[ 0 \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + 0 \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \xi_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi} + \eta_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial \eta} \]
    %
    is not tangent to $\mathcal{C}$. Then $X$ and $Y$ have coordinate systems $x = (x',x'')$ and $y = (y',y'')$ centered at $x_0$ and $y_0$, such that $\xi_0 = (1,\dots,0)$, $\eta_0 = (1,\dots,0)$, and the tangent plane to $\mathcal{C}$ is given by
    %
    \[ dx' = dy' \quad\text{and}\quad d\xi' = d\eta' \quad\text{and}\quad d\xi'' = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad d \eta'' = 0. \]
    %
    Then $(x',x'',\eta',y'')$ can be used as local coordinates for $\mathcal{C}$, and we can find a phase function $\phi(x,y'',\eta')$ such that $C$ is parameterized by $\phi$, in the sense that $\mathcal{C}$ locally agrees with $\Lambda_\phi$ on the coordinate system. Alternately, we can also find a phase $\phi(\xi',x'',y)$ such that $\mathcal{C}$ locally agrees with $\Lambda_\phi$.
\end{lemma}

Given an assumption of the existence of the coordinates of the form above, we can easily predict what their dimensions should be. If we define $\mathcal{C}_{y_0,\eta_0}$ to be the projection of $[T^* X \times \{ (y_0,\eta_0) \}] \cap \mathcal{C}$ onto $T^* X$, then we can see from the tangent space calculation above that if $x'$ and $y'$ are $k$-dimensional coordinates, then the dimension of the projection will be equal to $k + n$. The same is true for the projection of $\mathcal{C}_{x_0,\xi_0}$ onto $T^* Y$. \emph{In particular} if the projection is $n$-dimensional, then we can choose the function $\phi$ to have zero-dimensional homogeneous part. In this circumstance, we find that $\mathcal{C}$ is precisely given locally by the graph of a section $dH: X \times Y \to T^* X \times T^* Y$, i.e. locally $\mathcal{C}$ agrees with the set
%
\[ \left\{ \left(x,y, \nabla_x H, \nabla_y H \right) \right\}, \]
%
and moreover, we find that the second derivatives of $H$ vanish at the origin.

\section{Physical Explanation of Symplectic Geometry}

How does symplectic geometry arise in classical mechanics? In classical mechanics, the state of a physical system can be described by a point in some manifold $M$, together with a momentum vector $\xi \in T^*_x M$; the reason momentum is naturally a covector is because, given some velocity vector $v \in T_xM$, and some momentum vector $\xi$, the value $\xi(v)$ can naturally be identified with the \emph{kinectic energy} of the system, up to some constant of proportionality. The motion of the system is then induced by a function $H: T^* M \to \RR$, which gives, for each position $x \in M$ and $\xi \in T^*_xM$, the Hamiltonian $H(x,\xi)$ of the system (the total energy). If we define a function $L: TM \oplus T^*M \to \RR$ by setting, for each $(x,v,\xi) \in TM \oplus T^*M$,
%
\[ L(x,v,\xi) = \xi(v) - H(x,\xi), \]
%
then motion is then governed by the \emph{principle of least action}, which states that, the motion $(x(t), \xi(t))$ of the system is a \emph{local minimizer} of the \emph{action} $S$ of the physical system, given between two times $t_1$ and $t_2$ by
%
\[ S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(x(t), \dot{x}(t), \xi(t))\; dt. \]
%
Variational methods lead to Hamilton's equations of motion, expressed in coordinates by the equation
%
\[ \frac{dx_i}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \xi_i} \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{d\xi_i}{dt} = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_i}. \]
%
It is not immediately obvious from this equation that these equations are coordinate invariant, but we can see the invariance by seeing the relation to the symplectic geometry of the mechanics. Indeed, since $T^* M$ is a symplectic manifold, the covector field $dH: T^* M \to T^*(T^* M)$ can be identified using the symplectic bilinear form $\omega$ on each tangent space with a vector field $X_H: T^* M \to T(T^* M)$, and the equations of motion are given precisely by this vector field. If $(x,\xi)$ are the equations of motion, for any $(v_0,\dot{\xi}_0) \in T(T^*M)$, we have
%
\[ \omega( (v_0,\dot{\xi_0}), (\dot{x}, \dot{\xi}) ) = \omega((v_0,\dot{\xi}_0), X_H) = dH(v_0, \dot{\xi}_0), \]
%
so, tested against the tangent vector to motion, the symplectic form gives the change of energy from a particular shift in the state of a particle. Since energy is conserved, it is therefore natural that the form emerging from mechanics is skew adjoint. The form $\omega$ is of course independent of the function $H$, but one can use this intuition to interpret what the quantity $\omega((v_0,\dot{\xi_0}), (v,\dot{\xi}))$ is at any point for two elements in $T_{(x,\xi)}(T^* M)$; there exists a choice of energy function $H$ which causes a system starting at $(x,\xi)$ to move in the direction $(v,\dot{\xi})$, and the quantity above then gives the infinitisimal change of energy caused from shifting the system in the direction $(v_0,\dot{\xi_0})$.

From this point of view, it is natural to see how the concepts of symplectic geometry came into being. For any \emph{canonical transformation}, i.e. any symplectic isomorphism $F: T^* M \to T^* M$ of $T^* M$, which we can view as a change of coordinates, motion in the new coordinates generated by the Hamiltonian $H: T^* M \to \RR$ can be identified, using the isomorphism, with the motion generated by the Hamiltonian $H \circ F$. The concept of a canonical transformation was first introduced to allow one to simplify the form of a given Hamiltonian, i.e. historically, those emerging in the study of the motion of planets. We will see that, in a very similar light, symplectic geometry will allow us to simplify the \emph{phases} that occur in the oscillatory integrals that emerge in harmonic analysis (from the point of view of physics, this can be viewed as a \emph{quantization} of Hamiltonian mechanics).

For any two real-valued functions $H$ and $I$ on $T^* M$, we can consider their \emph{Poisson bracket}
%
\[ \{ H, I \} = \omega( X_H, X_I ) = dI(X_H), \]
%
which is also the \emph{Lie bracket} of the vector fields $X_H$ and $X_I$. If we consider the motion induced by $H$, then it follows that $\{ H, I \}$ gives the infinitisimal change in $I$ as a result of this motion. In particular, if $\{ H, I \} = 0$, then $I$ is preserved by the Hamiltonian dynamics induced by $H$. We then call $I$ an \emph{conserved quantity} of the system. This is how, for instance, conservation of momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and so on arises in physics, as a particular function $I$ which is conserved by Hamiltonians arising in Newtonian physics.

One way Lagrangian manifolds arise is via the \emph{Liouville-Arnold theorem}. A system of functions $I_1,\dots,I_d: T^* M \to \RR$ are called an \emph{integrable system} if they are \emph{generically} linearly independent, i.e. $dI_1 \wedge \dots \wedge dI_d$ is non-vanishing on a dense subset of $T^* M$, and the \emph{Poisson bracket} $\{ I_j, I_k \} = 0$ for all $j$ and $k$. Given an integrable system, we can consider the function $I: T^* M \to \RR^d$. For each regular value $\lambda \in \RR^d$ of this function, the level set $\Lambda = F^{-1}(\lambda)$ is a $d$ dimensional submanifold of $T^* M$, and is actually a \emph{Lagrangian submanifold}. Indeed, the tangent space of $\Lambda$ is generated by $X_{I_1}, \dots, X_{I_d}$, and we know by the Poisson bracket assumption that $[X_{I_j}, X_{I_k}] = 0$ for all $j$ and $k$, so that the tangent space is Lagrangian. The Liouville-Arnold theorem states that for any $j$, one can choose local coordinates $(\theta, \omega)$ on $U \subset T^* M$ around each point in $\Lambda$ such that
%
\[ \Lambda \cap U = \{ \omega = 0 \}, \]
%
and $\{ I_j, \theta_i \} = \omega_i$. If we set $H = I_j$, we therefore see that the flow induced by $H$ is given locally in this coordinate system by linearly shifting $\theta$ by $\omega$, and fixing $\omega$. Such coordinates are called \emph{action-angle coordinates}. The Liouville-Arnold theorem also proves the global results that the manifold $\Lambda$ is compact and connected, then it is isomorphic to $\TT^d$.

\begin{example}
    A harmonic oscillator on $\RR^d$ is given in a Newtonian formulation, in Euclidean coordinates by the equations
    %
    \[ \ddot{x}_i = - k_i^2 x_i, \]
    %
    The energy function here is
    %
    \[ H(x,\xi) = \xi \cdot x + (1/2) \sum k_i^2 x_i^2 = \sum \xi_i x_i + (1/2) k_i^2 x_i^2. \]
    %
    If we define
    %
    \[ H_i(x,\xi) = \xi_i x_i + (1/2) k_i^2 x_i^2 \]
    %
    then
    %
    \[ X_{H_i} = - x_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} + (\xi_i + k_i^2) \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^i}. \]
    %
    It is simple to check that $[X_{H_j}, X_{H_k}] = 0$, and that $H = \sum H_j$. It follows that under the harmonic oscillation, each of the quantities $\{ H_j \}$ is conserved. At any point away from the origin, the Liouville-Arnold theorem tells us the existence of an action-angle coordinate system $(\theta,\omega)$ around any point $(x^0,\xi^0)$ in $\Lambda$ which locally linearizes the motion of the system. Since we have
    %
    \[ (x_j(t), \xi_j(t)) = e^{itk_j} (x_j(t),\xi_j(t)), \]
    %
    we see that we should set
    %
    \[ \theta_j = (x_j^2 + \xi_j^2) \cdot \angle \{ (x_j,\xi_j), (x^0_j,\xi^0_j) \} \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ \omega_j = k_j (x_j^2 + \xi_j^2). \]
    %
    Thus the coordinates $\{ \theta_j \}$ really are `angles' in this sense. Note also that for each fixed $\lambda \neq 0$, the manifold $\Lambda = (H_1,\dots,H_d)^{-1}(\lambda)$ is isomorphic to $\TT^d$, as guaranteed by the Liouville-Arnold theorem.
\end{example}

TODO: If geodesic flow is integrable, then the Liouville-Arnold theorem implies that the geodesic flow is periodic?

\section{Semiclassical Approximations}

How do we move from classical mechanics to quantum physics? The story begins with the hydrogen atom, which consists of a negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged nucleus. Classically, the perception was that the electron orbited the nucleus, like a moon orbits planets. But this cannot be possible, since charged particles radiate energy when accelerated, causing them to lose energy. Thus an orbiting electron would radiate energy, and thus spiral into the nucleus of the proton.

In the early 20th century, de Broglie noticed that we could model the state of a particle as a wave
%
\[ \psi = e^{(i/\hbar)(\xi \cdot x - H t)}. \]
%
Assume the Hamiltonian $H$ can be given by
%
\[ H = \frac{|\xi|^2}{2m} + V, \]
%
where $V$ depends only on space. Then the equation can be rewritten as
%
\[ H \psi - \frac{|\xi|^2}{2m} \psi - V(x) \psi = 0. \]
%
Now in any given evolution of a particle, the Hamiltonian is constant, so we conclude that
%
\[ H \psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}. \]
%
Next, we have that
%
\[ \xi \psi = - i \hbar \nabla_x \psi \]
%
and thus
%
\[ |\xi|^2 \psi = - (\hbar^2 / m) \Delta_x \psi. \]
%
But this means that the constancy of energy equation becomes
%
\[ i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \Delta_x \psi = V \psi. \]
%
This is \emph{precisely} the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

In this form, Schr\"{o}dinger's equation is just a restatement of the conservation of energy in Hamiltonian mechanics. De Broglie's relation is also implicitly given by the equation, since the momentum of the particle modelled by $\psi$ is equal to $\hbar$ times the location of the spatial Fourier transform of $\psi$ in the $x$ variable. Quantum mechanics follows when we enforce the \emph{Born rule}, a postulate of quantum mechanics which states that a particle exists in an unknown probabilistic state modelled by a \emph{square integrable} solution $\psi$ to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, whose spatial distribution is given by $|\psi|^2$, and whose momentum distribution is given by $|\widehat{\psi}|^2$. The uncertainty principle prevents a particle from being arbitrarily localized in position-momentum space. But at large scales, the princ diple tends not to cause too much trouble, i.e. so that working with a classical mechanical formulation of physics on a large scale does not introduce too much error. \emph{Semiclassical analysis} is the study of how much intuition from classical mechanics holds at an \emph{intermediate scale} between classical and quantum mechanics, as well as applications of similar quantizations of other partial differential equations. In other words, it determines at what scale the \emph{correspondence principle} holds.















\chapter{Parametrices}

The Fourier transform provides a key way to understand spectral multipliers on a compact manifold $M$. If $h: (0,\infty) \to \CC$ is a function, and $P$ is a first order, elliptic, self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator on $M$, and $T = h(P)$, and if $\{ e_n \} \subset C^\infty(M)$ is an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions diagonalizing $L^2(M)$, such that $P e_n = - \lambda_n^2 e_n$, then we conclude that we have a kernel representation
%
\begin{align*}
    Tf(x) &= \sum h(\lambda_n) \langle f, e_n \rangle e_n\\
    &= \int_M \left( \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} \right) f(y)\; dy\\
    &= \int_M K(x,y) f(y)\; dy,
\end{align*}
%
where $K(x,y) = \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}$. The fact that this sum is often highly oscillatory prevents us from obtaining too much information directly from this expression aside from $L^2$ orthogonality. We can instead get more information by applying the Fourier transform. Namely, if $H$ is the cosine transform of $h$, i.e.
%
\[ H(t) = \int_0^\infty h(\lambda) \cos(2 \pi t \lambda)\; d\lambda, \]
%
then we have an inversion formula
%
\[ h(\lambda) = 4 \int H(t) \cos(2 \pi t \lambda)\; dt. \]
%
We can thus write
%
\begin{align*}
    \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} &= \sum_n \left[ 4 \int H(t) \cos(2 \pi t \lambda_n) \right] e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)}\\
    &= 4 \int H(t) \left[ \sum_n \cos(2 \pi t \lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} \right]\\
    &= 4 \int H(t) \cos \left(2 \pi t P \right)\; dt.
\end{align*}
%
The advantage of this approach is that if we know $h$ satisfies certain smoothness conditions, we can guarantee that $H$ has suitable decay. And we can understand the multiplier operators
%
\[ \cos \left( 2 \pi t P \right) \]
%
by virtue of the fact that these operators are the solution operators to the \emph{wave equation} $\partial_t^2 = 4 \pi^2 P$ on the manifold (with initial conditions starting with zero velocity), and so can be interpreted geometrically as wave propogators. If we treat $h$ as an even function, and apply the Fourier inversion formula, we could also write this equation as
%
\[ \sum_n h(\lambda_n) e_n(x) \overline{e_n(y)} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \widehat{h}(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
where the operators $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ are the propogators to the \emph{half-wave equation} $\partial_t = 2 \pi i P$, which, being a first order operator, is often less technical to work with, though has the disadvantage of not having a \emph{finite speed of propogation}.

A technicality behind the study of the wave equations above is that, being defined on a general compact manifold, these operators are no longer constant-coefficient partial differential equations, even if $P = \sqrt{-\Delta}$ and we are free to work locally in any coordinate system that we choose, because the manifold has \emph{curvature}. Thus we propogators cannot be treated as Fourier multipliers, as in the Euclidean case. We get around this by using the theory of Fourier integral operators to construct \emph{small-time parametrices} to the wave propogator. By a parametrix for the half-wave equation, we mean a family of operators $\{ S(t) \}$ such that for $|t| \lesssim 1$, $S(t) e^{2 \pi i t P} - 1$ is a smoothing operator, i.e. it is an operator with a kernel in $C^\infty(M \times M)$. And by a parametrix for the wave equation, we mean a family of operators $\{ S(t) \}$ such that for $|t| \lesssim 1$, $S(t) \cos(2 \pi i t P) - 1$ is a smoothing operator.

There are two choices of parametrix. The \emph{Lax parametrix} has a less explicit formula, but is a more general and applies to any pseudodifferential operator $P$. The \emph{Hadamard parametrix} applies to the wave equation, and when $P = \sqrt{-\Delta}$, but gives more geometric information about the behaviour of the operator, and also has the advantage that it can be constructed for larger times (up to the injectivity radius of the manifold rather than $O(1)$ time).






\section{The Lax Parametrix}

Let $P$ be a first order, classical, self-adjoint, elliptic pseudodifferential operator on a compact manifold $M$. Here we discuss a method due to Lax, which constructs a \emph{parametrix} for the equation $\partial_t = 2 \pi i P$ for $|t| \lesssim 1$, which is an operator given by \emph{Fourier integrals}. A similar parametrix exists for the wave equation $\partial_t^2 = - 4\pi^2 P$, obtained by using the fact that
%
\[ \cos\left( 2 \pi t \sqrt{-\Delta} \right) = (1/2) e^{2 \pi i P} + (1/2) e^{-2 \pi i P}. \]
%
The equation $\partial_t = 2 \pi i P$ is a pseudodifferential variant of a first order hyperbolic partial differential equation, which is where the method describe below first originated, in the work of Lax and H\"{o}rmander (TODO: Find these citations).

To state the main result of the Lax parametrix construction, we introduce the following notation: let $p: T^* M \to (0,\infty)$ denote the principal symbol of the operator $P$. We can then define a corresponding \emph{Hamiltonian vector field} $X_p$, obtained by applying duality to the covector field $dp: T^*M \to T^*(T^*M)$, with respect to the symplectic form on $T^* M$; in coordinates, we can write
%
\[ X_p = \sum_j \frac{\partial p}{\partial \xi_j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} - \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_j} \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_j}. \]
%
Let $\{ \varphi_t : T^* M \to T^* M \}$ denote the \emph{Hamiltonian flow} corresponding to the Hamiltonian vector field $X_p$. We can now state the main result of this section.

\begin{theorem}
    There exists an interval $I = \{ |t| \lesssim 1 \}$ centered at the origin, and a Schwartz operator $S$ mapping functions on $M$ to functions on $I \times M$, such that
    %
    \[ (\partial_t + 2 \pi i P) \circ S \]
    %
    is a \emph{smoothing operator}, i.e. with a Schwartz kernel lying in $C^\infty(I \times M \times M)$, such that $S$ is a Fourier integral operator of order $1/4$ associated with the canonical relation
    %
    \[ \mathcal{C} = \{ (t,x,y;\tau,\xi,\eta) : (x,\xi) = \varphi_t(y,\eta)\ \text{and}\ \tau = p(y,\eta) \}. \]
    %
    For each $t \in I$, the operator $S(t)$ on $M$ given by freezing the $t$ variable is then a Fourier integral operator of order zero, associated with the canonical relation
    %
    \[ \mathcal{C}_t = \{ (x,y;\xi,\eta) : (y,\eta) = \varphi_t(x,\xi) \}. \]
    %
    If we assume that for each $x \in M$, the cospheres
    %
    \[ \{ \varphi_t(x,\xi) : \xi \in T^*_x(M) \} \]
    %
    have everywhere non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, then $\mathcal{C}_t$ is the conormal bundle of the $2d-1$ dimensional submanifold
    %
    \[ \Sigma_t = \{ (x,y): y = \varphi_t(x,\xi)\ \text{for some $\xi \in T^*_x(M)$} \}. \]
    % dy = d_x varphi_t(x,xi) dx + d_xi varphi_t(x,xi)
    of $M \times M$.
\end{theorem}
% tau(|t| - d(x,y))
% |t| = d(x,y), then all tau are bad.

% Lambda is conormal to unit spheres.

% If p(x,xi) = |xi|, over R^1 x R^1
% Then the vector field is zero in the xi-dimension, and equal to [xi / |xi|] in the x direction. 

% Thus the Hamiltonian flow takes an initial point (x,xi) travels spatially
% at a unit velocity in the direction xi,
% and doesn't travel at all in the frequency direction.

% If p(x,xi) = y |xi| over (0,infty)_y x R^1
% Then the Hamiltonian vector field is equal to -|xi| in the xi direction, and y xi / |xi| in the x direction.
% - |xi| dxi + [x xi / |xi|] dx

% Regarldess, for each (x,xi), we can only travel in at most d-1 directions in the x-variable given the homogeneity of p.

We hope to find a parametrix for the half-wave operator, expressed as a Fourier integral operator of the form
%
\[ Sf(x,t) = S(t)f(x) = \int s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} f(y)\; dy\; d\xi, \]
%
such that:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Phi(t,x,y,\xi) = \phi(x,y,\xi) + t p(y,\xi)$, where $\phi$ is smooth away from $\xi = 0$, homogeneous of degree one, and $\phi(x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi$ in the sense that on the support of $s$,
    %
    \[ \partial^\beta_\xi \{ \phi(x,y,\xi) - (x - y) \cdot \xi \} \lesssim_\beta |x - y|^2 |\xi|^{1 - \beta}. \]
    %
    In particular, this implies that $\phi(x,y,\xi) = 0$ when $(x - y) \cdot \xi = 0$.

    \item $s$ is a symbol of order zero, supported on $|x - y| \lesssim 1$ and on $|\xi| \geq 1$, in such a way that
    %
    \[ |\nabla_\xi \phi(x,y,\xi)| \gtrsim |x - y| \quad\text{and}\quad |\nabla_x \phi(x,y,\xi)| \gtrsim |\xi| \]
    %
    for $(x,y) \in \text{supp}_x(s) \times \text{supp}_y(s)$.
\end{itemize}
%
Our goal is to choose $\phi$ and $s$ such that:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The operator $(\partial_t - 2 \pi i P) \circ S - 1$ is a smoothing operator on $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \times M$.

    \item $S(0)$ differs from the identity operator by a smoothing operator.
\end{itemize}
%
It then follows that $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} \circ S(t)$ is a smoothing operator for $|t| < \varepsilon$. An operator like $S$, which has a kernel given by an oscillatory integral with a homogeneous phase, is called a \emph{Fourier integral operator}.

To find a choice of $\phi$ and $s$ which gives us this parametrix, let us start by determining what properties these functions should satisfy. Let us fix a coordinate system $(x,U)$, where $x(U)$ is a precompact subset of $\RR^n$. Let us assume that in these coordinates, $P$ has symbol $P(x,\xi)$ and principal symbol $p(x,\xi)$. Then the kernel of $(\partial_t - 2 \pi i P) \circ S$ in this coordinate system is
%
\[ \int \{ \partial_t - 2 \pi i P(x,D_x) \} \left\{ s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} \right\}\; d\xi. \]
%
This operator can also be expressed as a Fourier integral, using the calculus of Fourier integral operators. Namely, we can write the operator as
%
\[ \int s'(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}, \]
%
where $s'$ is a symbol with an asymptotic expansion of the form
%
\begin{align*}
    s'(t,x,y,\xi) &\sim \partial_t s(t,x,y,\xi) + 2 \pi i p(y,\xi) s(t,x,y,\xi)\\
    &\quad - \sum_\alpha \frac{2 \pi i}{\alpha!} (\partial_\xi^\alpha P)(x, \nabla_x \phi(t,x,y,\xi)) \left. D^\alpha_z \left\{ s(t,z,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi'(t,x,y,z,\xi)} \right\} \right|_{z = x},
\end{align*}
%
where
%
\[ \Phi'(t,x,y,z,\xi) = \Phi(t,z,y,\xi) - \Phi(t,x,y,\xi) + (x - z) \cdot \nabla_x \Phi(t,x,y,\xi). \]
%
If we expect this operator to be smoothing, then the order zero part of the operator must vanish, i.e. we must first conclude that
%
\[ (2 \pi i) s(t,x,y,\xi) \cdot [p(y,\xi) - p(x, \nabla_x \phi(t,x,y,\xi))] \]
%
be a symbol of order $0$. It is therefore natural to choose $\phi$ such that
%
\[ p(y,\xi) = p(x,\nabla_x \phi(t,x,y,\xi)), \]
%
at least when $|x - y|$ is small (i.e. on the support of the symbol $s$), and $|\xi| \gtrsim 1$ (since the integral over $|\xi| \lesssim 1$ gives a smoothing operator). This is an \emph{Eikonal equation}, and we will briefly take an aside to discuss how such an equation using the basic theory of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. 

TODO: The manifold
%
\[ \Sigma = \{ (x,y,\xi,\eta): p(y,\eta) = p(x,\xi) \} \]
%
is coisotropic of codimension one, since the differential of the map $(x,y,\xi,\eta) \mapsto p(y,\eta) - p(x,\xi)$ is no-vanishing given that $p$ is elliptic. BUT MAYBE THE CURRENT PHASE FUNCTION RESULTS WE HAVE HERE DON'T GUARANTEE EXISTENCE YET.

The principal symbol $p$, a function on the cotangent bundle $T^* M$, induces a Hamiltonian vector field $H^p \in \Gamma(TM)$, such that for $f \in C^\infty(T^* M)$,
%
\[ H^p(f) = \left\{ p, f \right\} = \nabla_\xi p \cdot \nabla_x f - \nabla_x p \cdot \nabla_\xi f, \]
%
where $\{ \cdot, \cdot \}$ is the Poisson bracket. Let $\{ \psi_t \}$ denote the phase flow on $M$ induced by this vector field. Since $M$ is compact, and the vector field is homogeneous in the $\xi$ variable, one can see that the flow exists for all times.

\begin{lemma}
    For any $t$, $\psi_t$ is a canonical transformation of $T^* M$, and
    %
    \[ p \circ \psi_t = p, \]
    %
    i.e. $p$ is constant on it's \emph{bicharacteristics} (the integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector field).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    For any $(x_0,\xi_0) \in T^* M$, the function
    %
    \[ f(t) = p(\psi_t(x_0,\xi_0)) \]
    %
    has derivative
    %
    \[ f'(t) = H^p(p)(\psi_t(x_0,\xi_0)) = 0, \]
    %
    since $H^p(p) = 0$. But this means $f$ is a constant function, yielding the second part of the Lemma.

    To show that $\psi_t$ is a canonical transformation, let
    %
    \[ \sigma = \sum d\xi^j \wedge dx^j. \]
    %
    We use a similar argument, i.e. calculating
    %
    \[ \frac{d}{dt} \psi_t^* \sigma. \]
    %
    Since $\{ \psi_t \}$ is a semigroup, we have that
    %
    \[ \frac{d}{dt} \left. \psi_t^* \sigma \right|_{t = t_0} = \psi_{t_0}^* \frac{d}{dt} \left. \psi_t^* \sigma \right|_{t = 0}. \]
    %
    But
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \psi_t^* \sigma &= \sum_j \left( d \xi^j - t d \left\{ \frac{\partial p}{\partial x^j} \right\} \right) \wedge \left( dx^j + t d \left\{ \frac{\partial p}{\partial \xi^j} \right\} \right) + O(t^2)\\
        &= \sum_j (d\xi^j \wedge dx^j) + t \left( d\xi^j \wedge d \left\{ \frac{\partial p}{\partial \xi^j} \right\} - dx^j \wedge \left\{ \frac{\partial p}{\partial x^j} \right\} \right) + O(t^2),
    \end{align*}
    %
    and to show the derivative above is zero, it suffices to note that the mixed partial cancel out above.
\end{proof}

Now we can obtain the existence result. Working in coordinates, we may assume without loss of generality that we are working in $\RR^d$. We return to finding a solution $\phi$ to the equation
%
\[ p(y,\xi) = p(x,\nabla_x \phi(x,y,\xi)). \]
%
To do this, we fix $y$, and $|\xi_0| = 1$, and try and define $\psi(x) = \phi(x,y,\xi)$ such that
%
\[ p(y,\xi) = p(x, \nabla_x \psi(x)), \]
%
such that $\psi(x) = 0$ if $x$ lies in the hyperplane
%
\[ H = \{ x : x \cdot \xi = y \cdot \xi \}, \]
%
and such that $\nabla_x \psi(y) = \xi$. This latter assumption, that $\xi \neq 0$, together with the implicit function theorem, shows there exists a unique function $a$ defined uniquely on a neighborhood of $y$ in $H$ in such a way that $p(y,\xi) = p(x, a(x))$. Define
%
\[ S_0(x) = (x,a(x)), \]
%
Then the image of $S_0$ is a symplectic submanifold of $T^* H$, and $p(y,\xi) = p \circ S_0$. If we now define a section $S$ on a neighborhood of $y$ by extending $S_0$ along the bicharacteristics of $p$, then the fact that $p$ is constant along the bicharacteristics implies that $p(y,\xi) = p \circ S$, and that the bicharacteristics are canonical transformations implies that $S$ is a Lagrangian section. But for \emph{any} Lagrangian section, we can find a function $\psi$, defined in a neighborhood of $y$, such that
%
\[ S(x) = ( x, \nabla_x \psi(x) ). \]
%
This is the function we were required to find. TODO: Draw a picture of what's going on.

Now

%
If we set
%
\[ s'(t,x,y,\xi) = e^{- 2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} (\partial_t - 2 \pi i P(x,D)) \left\{ s(t,\cdot,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,\cdot,y,\xi)} \right\} \]
%
then the kernel is
%
\[ \int s'(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
%
Provided that $s'$ is a symbol of order $-\infty$ for $0 < |t| \leq \varepsilon$, integration by parts shows that $(\partial_t + 2 \pi i P) \circ S$ is smoothing, and so we will try to choose $\phi$ and $s$ so as to obtain such a result.

In our discussion of pseudodifferential operators, we have already discussed an asymptotic formula for $s'$, namely, if
% Phi(t,x,y,xi) = phi(x,y,xi) - t p(y,xi)
% phi(x,y,xi) = (x - y) * xi + O(|x-y|^2 |xi|)
% nabla_x phi = xi + nabla_x O( |x - y|^2 |xi| )
%
\begin{align*}
    r_{x,y}(z) &= \nabla_x \phi(x,z,\xi) \cdot (x - z) - \{ \phi(x,y,\xi) - \phi(z,y,\xi) \}.
\end{align*}
%
then for any $N > 0$, if $a \sim \sum_{k = -\infty}^1 a_k$, where $a_k$ is homogeneous of degree $k$, and if $\xi_\phi = \nabla_x \Phi(t,x,y,\xi) = \nabla_x \phi(x,y,\xi)$,
% Symbol of (partial_t + 2 pi i P) is
% 2 pi i (tau + a(x,xi))
\begin{align*}
    s' & (t,x,y,\xi)\\
    &= \underbrace{ \left( p(y,\xi) - a(x, \xi_\phi) \right) \cdot s(t,x,y,\xi) }_{\text{symbols of order 1}}\\
    &\quad + \underbrace{\partial_t s(t,x,y,\xi)}_{\text{symbol of order $0$}}  \\
    &\quad - \sum_{1 \leq |\beta| < N} \underbrace{\frac{2 \pi i}{\beta! \cdot (2 \pi i)^\beta} \cdot \partial_\xi^\beta a(x, \xi_\phi) \partial_z^\beta \{ e^{2 \pi i r_{x,y}(z)} s(t,z,y,\xi) \} |_{z = y}}_{\text{symbols of order $1 - \lceil |\beta| / 2 \rceil$}}\\
    &\quad + R_N(t,x,y,\xi).
\end{align*}
%
where, because $|\nabla_x \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)| \gtrsim |\xi|$ on the support of $s$,
%
\[ \langle \xi \rangle^{t - \lceil N/2 \rceil} R_N \in L^\infty((-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \times U \times U \times \RR^d). \]
%
It is simple to  establish estimates of the form
%
\[ |\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\lambda s'(t,x,y,\xi)| \lesssim \langle \xi \rangle^{N_{\alpha \beta \lambda}}. \]
%
Thus if we can justify that $|s'(t,x,y,\xi)| \lesssim_N \langle \xi \rangle^{-N}$ for all $N > 0$, then it will follow that $s'$ is a symbol of order $-\infty$. We now determine the propoerties of the symbol $s$ and the symbol $\phi$ which will give us these estimates.

To begin with, let us specify the function $\phi$. In order to guarantee that $s'$ is a symbol of order zero, the expansion above shows that $(p(y,\xi) - p(x,\xi_\phi)) \cdot s(t,x,y,\xi)$ must be a symbol of order zero. This will be true if we can pick $\phi$ such that, on the support of $s$, and for $|\xi| \gtrsim 1$,
%
\[ p(x, \nabla_x \phi(x,y,\xi)) = p(y,\xi). \]
%
This is an example of an \emph{Eikonal equation}, e.g. an equation of the form
%
\[ q(z,\nabla_z \psi(z)) = 0 \]
%
for some function $q(z,\zeta)$. In our case, $z = (x,y,\xi)$, so $\zeta = (\zeta_x, \zeta_y,\zeta_\xi)$, and so
%
\[ q(z,\zeta) = p(x,\zeta_x) - p(y,\xi). \]
%
Let us make some further remarks we desire about our choice of function $\phi$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item We want $\phi$ to be homogeneous and smooth away from the origin. If we solve the equation for all $|\xi| = 1$, and then extend $\phi$ such that for $\lambda > 0$ and $|\xi| = 1$,
    %
    \[ \phi(x,y,\lambda \xi) = \lambda \phi(x,y,\xi) \psi(\lambda), \]
    %
    where $\psi$ is smooth, equal to one for $|\lambda| \geq 3/4$, and vanishing for $|\lambda| \leq 1/2$, then $\phi$ will satisfy the equation for all $|\xi| \gtrsim 1$. This means that
    %
    \[ p(x,\nabla_x \phi(x,y,\xi)) - p(y,\xi) \]
    %
    is smooth and supported on $|\xi| \lesssim 1$, which implies it is a symbol of order $-\infty$, which suffices for our construction. Thus it suffices to solve the equation for $|\xi| = 1$.

    \item Since $\phi$ is smooth away from the origin and homogeneous, the equation
    %
    \[ |\partial_\xi^\beta \left\{ \phi(x,y,\xi) - (x - y) \cdot \xi \right\}| \lesssim_\beta |x - y|^2 \langle \xi \rangle^{1 - \beta} \]
    %
    holds if, for $|\xi| = 1$, we have $\phi(x,y,\xi) = 0$ whenever $(x - y) \cdot \xi = 0$, and $\nabla_x \phi(x,y,\xi) = \xi$ whenever $x = y$. Thus we have some \emph{initial conditions} for our Eikonal equation.
\end{itemize}
%
The second condition constitutes a type of initial condition for $\phi$, since it specifies it's behaviour on a hypersurface, a kind of Cauchy condition, and thus we should expect these are close to the conditions that give unique solutions to the equation. And the following Lemma indeed shows that there is a unique function $\phi$, defined for $|x - y| \lesssim 1$ and $|\xi| = 1$ with these properties.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $Z$ be a smooth manifold, and let $q(z,\zeta)$ be a real-valued, smooth function defined locally around a point $(z_0,\zeta_0) \in T^*Z$. Let $S$ be a smooth hypersurface in $Z$ passing through $z_0$ with conormal vector $\zeta_S$ at $z_0$, such that
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial q}{\partial \zeta_S}(z_0,\zeta_0) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{q(z_0,\zeta_0 + t \zeta_S) - q(z_0,\zeta_0)}{t} \]
    %
    is nonzero. Suppose that $\psi$ is any smooth function defined on $S$ locally about $z_0$, such that $d \psi(z_0)$ agrees with the action of $\zeta_0$ on $T_{x_0} S$. Then there exists a unique smooth function $\phi$ defined in a neighborhood of $z_0$, which agrees with $\psi$ on $S$, satisfies the Eikonal equation $q(z,\nabla_z \phi(z)) = 0$, and has $\nabla_z \phi(z_0) = \zeta_0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    TODO: See Sogge, Theorem 4.1.1.
\end{proof}

In our case,
%
\[ Z = \{ (x,y,\xi) : |\xi| = 1 \}. \]
%
We have $z_0 = (x_0,x_0,\xi_0)$, $\zeta_0 = (\xi,\xi,0)$, and
%
\[ S = \{ (x,y,\xi): |\xi| = 1 \quad\text{and}\quad (x - y) \cdot \xi = 0 \}. \]
%
The conormal vector $\xi_S$ of $S$ at $z_0$ is a multiple of $(\xi_0,-\xi_0,0)$, and so by homogeneity,
%
\[ \frac{\partial q}{\partial \xi_S} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{p(x_0,(1 + t)\xi_0) - p(x_0,\xi_0)}{t} = p(x_0,\xi_0), \]
%
which is nonvanishing because $P$ is elliptic. If we define $\psi$ equal to zero on $S$, then $d \psi = 0$, which agrees with the action of $\zeta_0$ on $S$. Thus the theorem applies local uniqueness and existence to solutions to the Eikonal equation, and by compactness of $Z$ we can patch such solutions together to find a solution defined for all $|x - y| \lesssim 1$.

We therefore conclude that there exists a unique choice of $\phi$ such that, if $s$ has small enough support, $s'(t,x,y,\xi)$ is a symbol of order zero. Next, let us see what constraints are forced on us in order to ensure that $S(0)$ differs from the identity by a smoothing operator. The kernel of $U$ is precisely
%
\[ \int s(0,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
%
We now show that this operator is actually a \emph{pseudodifferential operator} of order zero, and determine it's symbol up to first order.

To do this, we write $\phi_\alpha(x,y,\xi) = (1 - \alpha) \phi(x,y,\xi) + \alpha (x - y) \cdot \xi$. Let $U_\alpha$ be the operator with kernel
%
\[ \int s(0,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi_\alpha(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
%
Assume the support of $s$ is close enough to the diagonal such that
%
\[ |\nabla_\xi \phi_\alpha(x,y,\xi)| \gtrsim |x - y| \]
%
on the support of $s$. Then $\partial_\alpha^n U_t$ has kernel
%
\[ \int (2 \pi i)^n ( \phi_1 - \phi_0 )^n s(0,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi_\alpha(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
%
This is an oscillatory integral defined by a symbol of order $n$. However, when $t = 1$, the fact that $\phi(x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi$, together with the formula for converting pseudodifferential operators with compound symbols into standard Kohn-Nirenberg type symbols shows that $\partial_\alpha^n U_1$ is actually a pseudodifferential operator of order $-n$. Integration by parts, similarily, shows that $\partial_\alpha^n U_t$ is defined by an oscillator integral against a symbol of order $-n$. But this means that if we define a pseudodifferential operator by the asymptotic formula
%
\[ V \sim \sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \partial_\alpha^n U_1, \]
%
then $U - V$ is smoothing. Indeed, for any $n$, by Taylor's formula we have
%
\[ U = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \partial_\alpha^n U_1 + \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \int_0^1 \alpha^{n-1} \partial_\alpha^n U_\alpha\; d\alpha \]
%
The integral here is an oscillatory integral defined against a symbol of order $-n$, and thus taking $n \to \infty$ verifies the claim.

It is an important remark that reversing this argument shows that \emph{any} pseudodifferential operator can be written in the form above for the particular choice of $\phi$ we have given. This is a special case of the \emph{equivalence of phase functions} theorem. This in particular guarantees that we can choose a symbol $I(x,y,\xi)$ of order zero such that $U - 1$ is smoothing if and only if $s(0,x,y,\xi) - I(x,y,\xi)$ is a symbol of order $-\infty$. The symbol $I$ can be chosen to be vanishing for $|x - y| \gtrsim 1$, since the difference will be a smoothing pseudodifferential operator.

Next, the quantity
%
\begin{align*}
    &\partial_t s(t,x,y,\xi)\\
    &\quad\quad + \sum_{k = 1}^d \partial_\xi^k a(x,\xi_\phi) \partial_x^k s(t,x,y,\xi)\\
    &\quad\quad + \left( a_0(x,\xi_\phi) + \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_{|\beta| = 2} \partial_\xi^\beta p(x,\xi_\phi) \partial_x^\beta \phi(x,y,\xi) \right) s(t,x,y,\xi).
\end{align*}
%
must be a symbol of order $-1$. But because the coefficients of this equation are smooth, and all derivatives are bounded, it follows from the general theory of transport equations that there exists a unique smooth, function $s_0$ defined for $|t| \leq \varepsilon$, which is a symbol of order zero, such that $s_0(0,x,y,\xi) = I(x,y,\xi)$, $s_0$ vanishes for $|x - y| \gtrsim 1$, and satisfies the transport equation
%
\begin{align*}
    &\partial_t s_0(t,x,y,\xi)\\
    &\quad\quad + \sum_{k = 1}^d \partial_\xi^k a(x,\xi_\phi) \partial_x^k s_0(t,x,y,\xi)\\
    &\quad\quad + \left( a_0(x,\xi_\phi) + \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_{|\beta| = 2} \partial_\xi^\beta p(x,\xi_\phi) \partial_x^\beta \phi(x,y,\xi) \right) s_0(t,x,y,\xi) = 0.
\end{align*}
%
We have thus justified that the quantity
%
\[ R_0(t,x,y,\xi) = e^{-2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} (\partial_t - 2 \pi i P)(s_0(t,\cdot,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}) \]
%
is a symbol of order $-1$. Now we come to a quirk of this parametrix, which does not occur in the study of hyperbolic partial differential equations. Since the operator $P(x,D)$ is only \emph{pseudolocal} rather than completely local, the remainder term $R_0$ is \emph{not} necessarily supported on a neighborhood of the origin. To fix this, we now successively define the terms $\{ s_k \}$ for $k < 0$, which are symbols of order $-k$, such that $s_k(0,x,y,\xi) = 0$, and
%
\[ TODO: SPECIFY REQUIRED EQUATION. \]
%
Again, solutions exist for small time periods. And this implies that $e^{-2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} (\partial_t + 2 \pi i P)((s_0 + \dots + s_{-k}) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)})$ is a symbol of order $-k$ (TODO: Is It), and we can continue the calculation to complete the argument.

% PROBLEMS WITH EXTENDING TO ALL TIMES
%       CANNOT ASSUME |x - y| << 1
%           - SO this means that oscillatory integrals become bad.

\begin{comment}
\begin{lemma}
    Consider an operator of the form
    %
    \[ Sf(x) = \int a(x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,\xi)} f(y)\; dy\; d\xi, \]
    %
    where $a \in S^r$ and vanishes for $|x - y| \gtrsim 1$, $\phi \in S^1$, and is homogeneous of degree one in $\xi$, $|\nabla_\xi \phi(x,y,\xi)| \gtrsim |x - y|$ on the support of $a$, and for all $r > 0$,
    %
    \[ \partial^\beta_\xi \{ \phi(x,y,\xi) - (x - y) \cdot \xi \} \lesssim_\beta |x - y|^2 |\xi|^{1-|\beta|}. \]
    %
    Then $S$ is well defined, and is actually a pseudodifferential operator of order $r$. If $T$ is the pseudodifferential operator with symbol $(x,\xi) \mapsto a(x,x,\xi)$, then $T - S$ is a pseudodifferential operator of order $r-1$.

    Conversely, for \emph{any} $\Psi DO$ $T$ of order $r$, there exists a symbol $a$ of order $r$ such that for the resulting operator $S$ of order $r$, $S - T$ is a smoothing operator.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let us first define the operator $S$. Let $\phi_0(x,y,\xi) = (x - y) \cdot \xi$, $\phi_1(x,y,\xi) = \phi(x,y,\xi)$, $\phi_t = t \phi_1 + (1 - t) \phi_0$, and define $S_t$ with the phase function $\phi_t$ and symbol $a$. Note that $|\nabla_\xi \phi_t| \gtrsim |x - y|$, uniformly in $t$. This enables us to compute the kernel $K_t(x,y)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$. For $t = 0$ we have a pseudodifferential operator, and for $t = 1$, we get the kernel $K(x,y)$ we get to compute. It is also simple to see that, since $|\nabla_\xi \phi_t| \gtrsim |x - y|$, that for large $N$,
    %
    \[ K(x,y)| \lesssim_N \frac{1}{|x - y|^N}, \]
    %
    so we already see that $S$ is somewhat pseudolocal.

    We have
    %
    \[ \frac{\partial^N K_t(x,y)}{\partial t^N} = (2 \pi i)^N \int (\phi_1(x,y,\xi) - \phi_0(x,y,\xi))^N a(x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi_t(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
    %
    Now $(\phi_1 - \phi_0)^N \cdot a$ is a symbol of order $r + N$. But on the other hand, using the fact that $(\phi_1 - \phi_0)^N \lesssim |x - y|^{2N} |\xi|^N$, and thus vanishes to order $2N$ on the diagonal, then combined with the fact that $|\nabla_\xi \phi(x,y,\xi)| \gtrsim |x - y|$, we actually see via an integration by parts $2N$ times in $\xi$ that we can rewrite the integral in terms of a symbol of order $r - N$ and the same phase $\phi_t$. Applying Taylor's theorem, we write
    %
    \[ K(x,y) = K_1(x,y) = \sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} \frac{1}{k!} \left. \frac{\partial^k K_t(x,y)}{\partial t^k} \right|_{t = 1} + \frac{1}{N!} \int_0^1 t^{N-1} \frac{d^NK_t(x,y)}{dt^N}\; dt. \]
    %
    This integral gives an arbitrarily smooth kernel as $N \to \infty$. Thus if we let $T$ be a pseudodifferential operator of order $r$ such that
    %
    \[ T \sim \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \left. \frac{\partial^k K_t(x,y)}{\partial t^k} \right|_{t = 1}, \]
    %
    then $T - S$ is a smoothing operator. Now if $\tilde{T}$ is the pseudodifferential operator corresponding to the symbol $a(x,x,\xi)$, then $T - \tilde{T}$, and thus $S - \tilde{T}$, is a pseudodifferential operator of order $r-1$. The converse is similar, working in the opposite direction, i.e. from $t = 1$ to $t = 0$, and is left as an exercise.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

%Since $I$ is a $\Psi DO$ of order zero, we can find a symbol $a$ of order zero such that if $T$ is the operator with kernel
%
%\[ \int a(x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi, \]
%
%then $T - I$ is a smoothing operator. To ensure that $S(0) - I$ is a smoothing operator, it is natural to insist that $s(0,x,y,\xi) = a(x,y,\xi)$. We note in particular that since $I$ is a $\Psi DO$ with $1$ as a symbol, this implies $s(0,x,x,\xi) - 1$ is a symbol of order $-1$.









\chapter{Distributions on Riemannian Manifolds}

How do we work with distributions on $\RR^d$? We first identify a vector space of test functions, say, the space $\DD(\RR^d)$ of smooth, compactly supported functions, the space $\EC(\RR^d)$ of all smooth functions, or the space $\SW(\RR^d)$ of Schwartz functions. The distributions are then formally defined as the dual space of this class of test functions. To actually work with these distributions, we find an explicit way to represent them, via a bilinear pairing; for $\DD(\RR^d)$, the bilinear pairing $\EC(\RR^d) \times \DD(\RR^d) \to \CC$ given by
%
\[ (\phi,\psi) \mapsto \int_{\RR^d} \phi(x) \psi(x)\; dx. \]
%
This pairing induces a natural identification of $\EC(\RR^d)$ with a dense subclass of $\DD(\RR^d)^*$. Thus we can intuitively study elements of $\DD(\RR^d)^*$ as if they behaved like elements of $\EC(\RR^d)$, at least when integrated against elements of $\DD(\RR^d)$. Reversing this pairing allows us to think of elements of $\EC(\RR^d)^*$ as elements of $\DD(\RR^d)$, and the pairing $\SW(\RR^d) \times \SW(\RR^d) \to \CC$ allows us to think of tempered distributions of $\SW(\RR^d)$ as if they themselves were elements of $\SW(\RR^d)$.

The bilinear pairings here often behave well with respect to natural operations on the respective spaces. For instance, we have integration by parts identities
%
\[ ( \partial^\alpha \phi, \psi ) = (-1)^{|\alpha|} (\phi, \partial^\alpha \psi) \]
%
for all the pairings above. And for the pairing of $\SW(\RR^d)$, we have the multiplication formula
%
\[ ( \mathcal{F} \phi, \psi ) = \Big( \phi , \mathcal{F} \psi \Big), \]
%
where $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform. By taking weak limits, this allows us to extend the derivative and Fourier transform operations for distributions. In particular, we can take the derivatives of elements of $\DD(\RR^d)^*$, $\EC(\RR^d)^*$ and $\SW(\RR^d)^*$, and we can take the Fourier transform of elements of $\SW(\RR^d)^*$. By taking pairings of vector fields, i.e. by setting
%
\[ (X, Y) = \int (X \cdot Y)\; dx \]
%
where $X$ and $Y$ are smooth vector fields, with $X$ having compact support, we can define vector-valued distributions, and the theory above extends analogously.

We can also define other operations on distributions as if they were functions, provided that we have information about their \emph{wavefront sets}. For any distribution $u$, it's wavefront set $\text{WF}(u)$ to be a subset of $\RR^d_x \times \RR^d_\xi$, conic in the variable $\xi$, which gives information about the position and `direction' of the singularities of $u$. As an example of how the wavefront set is useful,  if $f: \RR^n_x \to \RR^m_y$ is smooth, and $u \in \DD(\RR^m)$ is a distribution such that $\text{WF}(u)$ does not contain any point of the form $(y,\eta)$ for which there exists $x \in f^{-1}(y)$ with $Df(x)^t \eta = 0$, then we can define a distribution $f^* u$ on $\RR^n$, which can be interpreted as a weak limit of a sequence $\{ f^* u_n \}$, where $u_n \in \EC(\RR^m)$ converging weakly to $u$ in a way respecting the wavefront set of $u$; the advantage of this is that $f^* u_n$ is just $u_n \circ f$, and thus easy to work with.

%If $\phi \in \EC(\RR^m)$, then the chain rule
%
%\[ \nabla (\phi \circ f) (x) = Df(x)^t \nabla \phi(f(x)) \]
%
%is equivalent to the statement that for any smooth, compactly supported vector field $X$ on $\RR^n_x$,
%
%\[ ( \nabla (f^* \phi), X) = ( f^*( \nabla \phi ), Df \cdot X ),  \]
%
%which allows us to extend the chain rule to the pullback of distributions, where the gradient of a distribution is viewed as a vector valued distribution, except that we have to view $Df \cdot X$ as a smooth, compactly supported function from $\RR^n_x$ to $\RR^m_x$, and $f^*( \nabla \phi )$ as a functional on this space.

Now let's do the same thing on a Riemannian manifold $M^d$. Here we also have natural spaces of test functions, i.e. the spaces $\EC(M)$ and $\DD(M)$ of smooth functions, the latter of which specified to have compact support. Here the natural pairing $\EC(M) \times \DD(M) \to \CC$ is given by integration against the \emph{volume measure} on the manifold $M$, i.e. the pairing is given by
%
\[ (\phi,\psi)_g \mapsto \int_M \phi(x) \psi(x)\; dV_g(x). \]
%
This pairing allows us to identify $\EC(M)^*$ and $\DD(M)^*$ with weak limits of elements of $\DD(M)$ and $\EC(M)$ respectively. It will also be convenient to consider \emph{vector-valued distributions}, i.e. the dual spaces of the spaces $\EC(\Gamma(TM))$ and $\DD(\Gamma(TM))$ of smooth vector fields, the latter of which limited to have compact support. These spaces have a pairing given by
%
\[ (X,Y)_g \mapsto \int_M \langle X, Y \rangle_g\; dV_g. \]
%
Thus we can identify the dual spaces $\EC(\Gamma(TM))^*$ and $\DD(\Gamma(TM))^*$ with weak limits of vector fields, the latter being uniformly compactly supported.

On a Riemannian manifold, the natural derivative operators to consider are the \emph{gradient operator}, which, for a given function $f \in \EC(M)$, gives a smooth vector field $\nabla_g f \in \Gamma(TM)$, which has the property that for any other smooth vector field $X \in \Gamma(TM)$,
%
\[ X(f) = \langle X, \nabla_g f \rangle_g. \]
%
We also have a \emph{divergence operator}, which associates with any smooth vector field $X \in \Gamma(TM)$ a smooth function $\nabla_g \cdot X$ such that the integration by parts identity
%
\[ \int_M \big\langle \nabla_g f, X \big\rangle_g\; dV_g = - \int_M f\; (\nabla_g \cdot X)\; dV_g \]
%
holds when either $X$ or $f$ has compact support. This formula gives us a way to interpret the gradient $\nabla_g u \in \DD(\Gamma(TM))^*$ of a general distribution $u \in \DD(M)^*$; i.e. such that $\nabla_g u$ is the vector-valued distribution such that for any $X \in \DD(\Gamma(M))$,
%
\[ ( \nabla_g u, X ) = - ( u, \nabla_g \cdot X ). \]
%
Similarily, we can consider the divergence $\nabla_g \cdot X \in \DD(M)^*$ of a distributional vector fields $X \in \DD(\Gamma(TM))^*$. Combining these operators gives us the \emph{Laplace-Beltrami operator} $\Delta_g f = \nabla_g \cdot \nabla_g f$, which we can now consider as a map from $\DD(M)^*$ to itself, and from $\EC(M)^*$ to itself. We note that in coordinates, we have
%
\[ \nabla_g f = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} g^{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}, \]
%
and the divergence is given by
%
\[ \nabla_g \cdot X = |g|^{-1/2} \sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \left\{ |g|^{1/2} X^i \right\}, \]
%
where $|g|$ is the determinant of the matrix with coefficients $\{ g_{ij} \}$, which we can roughly think of as the volume of the unit ball in the metric.

%The wavefront set of a distribution $u$ on a manifold $M$ is coordinate independent, provided we interpret the set as a conic subset of $T^* M$. Given a smooth map $f: M \to M'$, where $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ are Riemannian manifolds, let's try and obtain a version of the chain rule. We note that for any smooth function $\phi$ on $N$, any $p \in M$, and any vector $X \in T_p M$,
%
%\[ \Big\langle ( \nabla_g f^* \phi)_p, X_p \Big\rangle_g = \langle (\nabla_g \phi)_{f(p)}, f_* X_p \rangle_{g'}. \]
%
%\begin{align*}
%    \langle ( \nabla_g f^* \phi)(p), X_p \rangle_{g} &= X_p( f^* \phi )\\
%    &= d(f^* \phi)(X_p)\\
%    &= [f^* d \phi](p)(X_p)\\
%    &= (d\phi)(f(p)) ( f_* X_p )\\
%    &= \langle (\nabla_g \phi)_{f(p)}, f_* X_p \rangle_{g'}.
%\end{align*}
%
%If $X$ is a vector field, and we integrate in $dV_g$ on both sides, we conclude that
%
%\[ ( \nabla_g f^* \phi, X ) = ( f^* \nabla_g \phi, f_* X ). \]
%
%where the right hand side of the equation above is defined by the pairing $\Gamma(f^*(TM')) \times \Gamma(f^*(TM')) \to \CC$ given by
%
%\[ ( Z, W ) = \int \langle Z, W \rangle_{g'}\; dV_g. \]
%
%This formula remains true when $\phi$ is replaced by a distribution $u$, such that the pullback $f^* u$ is well defined.







\chapter{The Hadamard Parametrix}

The Hadamard parametrix gives an alternate expression as a wave to invert the wave equation on a Riemannian manifold, though one requires much tighter control of the geometry of the underlying Riemannian manifold. We begin with summarizing facts about the fundamental solution of the standard wave equation on $\RR^{d+1}$, before moving onto fundamental solutions of the wave equation on $\RR^{d+1}$ with an arbitrary \emph{constant coefficient} Riemannian metric, and then we move to constructing a small-time parametrix on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold.

%Before we do this, however, let's recall how we define the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a given Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We want to extend the formula $\Delta f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f$, which requires we interpret the gradient and divergence on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold. The gradient is easy; for any $f \in C^\infty(M)$, we can consider the covector field $df \in C^\infty(M)$, and we let the gradient $\nabla f$ be the vector field obtained from $df$ via the musical isomorphism, i.e. such that for any other vector field $X \in \Gamma(TM)$,
%
%\[ \langle \nabla f, X \rangle_g = df(X). \]
%
%If, in a given coordinate system $(x,U)$ on $M$, we write
%
%\[ g = \sum_{ij} g_{ij} dx^i dx^j \quad \nabla_g f = \sum (\nabla_g f)^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \quad\text{and}\quad X = \sum X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \]
%
%then we obtain that
%
%\[ \sum_{ij} g_{ij} (\nabla_g f)^i X^j = \sum \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} X^i, \]
%
%Since $X$ is arbitrary, we conclude that
%
%\[ \nabla_g f = \sum \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} g^{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}. \]
%
%Next, to define the divergence, we hope that the integration by parts identity
%
%\[ \int_M \langle X, \nabla_g f \rangle_g\; dV_g = - \int_M (\nabla_g \cdot X) f\; dV_g \]
%
%for compactly support smooth $f$ and $X$, where $dV_g = |g|^{1/2} dx^1 \cdots dx^d$, and where $|g| = \det(g_{ij})$. If $f$ and $X$ have support on $U$, then we can work in coordinates, and we obtain the Euclidean identity
%
%\[ \int \sum_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \left\{ |g|^{1/2} X^i \right\} dx^1 \cdots dx^d = \int - |g|^{1/2} (\nabla_g \cdot X) f\; dx^1 \cdots\; dx^d. \]
%
%But Euclidean integration by parts gives that we should set
%
%\[ \nabla_g \cdot X = |g|^{-1/2} \sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \left\{ |g|^{1/2} X^i \right\}. \]
%
%Combining our definition of the divergence with the gradient, we now have a Laplace-Beltrami operator
%
%\[ \Delta_g f = \nabla_g \cdot \nabla_g f = |g|^{-1/2} \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \left\{ |g|^{1/2} g^{ij} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} \right\}. \]
%
%We then define the wave operator $\Box_g$ on $M \times \RR$ by setting $\Box_g f = \partial_t^2 f - \Delta_g f$.

\section{Euclidean Case}

Let's begin with the standard wave equation on $\RR^d$, equipped with the standard metric. We are therefore concerned with constructing a fundamental solution for the d'Alembertian operator $\Box = \partial_t^2 - \Delta_x$ on $\RR^{d + 1}$. One choice of fundamental solution for $\Box$ is the \emph{forward fundamental solution}, defined for $d \geq 2$ by the equation
%
\[ E_+(x,t) = c_d \cdot \frac{H(t)}{\text{Im} \left\{ (|x|^2 - (t + i0)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \right\}} \]
%
where $H$ is the heaviside step function, and
%
\[ c_d = \frac{2}{(n+1) A_{n+1}}, \]
%
where $A_{n+1}$ denotes the surface area of $S^n$. We have
%
\[ \text{Supp}(E_+) = \{ (x,t): t \geq 0\ \text{and}\ |x| \leq t \}, \]
%
Furthermore, we have
%
\[ \text{Sing\ Supp}(E_+) = \{ (x,t): t \geq 0\ \text{and}\ |x| = t \}, \]
%
i.e. $E_+$ has singular support on the \emph{forward light cone}. When $d$ is odd, one can see from the formula above that $E_+$ actually has \emph{support} on the forward light cone; this is \emph{Huygen's principle}. For $d = 2$, we have
%
\[ E_+(t,x) = H(t) \frac{H(t^2 - |x|^2)}{2 \pi (t^2 - |x|^2)^{1/2}}, \]
%
where the right hand side is locally integrable, and thus defines a distribution. For $d = 3$, we have
%
\[ E_+(t,x) = H(t) \frac{\delta(t^2 - |x|^2)}{2 \pi} = H(t) \frac{\delta(t - |x|)}{4 \pi t}. \]
%
When $d \geq 4$, the forward fundamental solution becomes a distribution of higher order, i.e. becoming more singular on the forward light cone. For $d = 2$ the equation above no longer applies, but we have the simpler formula
%
\[ E_+(t,x) = \frac{H(t) H(t^2 - |x|^2)}{2}. \]
%
It is interesting to note that $E_+$ is the \emph{unique} fundamental solution which has the finite speed of propogation property, i.e. it is supported on the interior of the forward light cone.

\begin{lemma}
    If $v$ is a fundamental solution of the D'Alembertian, supported on the interior of the forward light cone, then $v = E_+$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    If $u = v - E_+$, then $u$ is supported on the interior of the forward light cone and $\Box u = 0$. But this means that
    %
    \[ u = \delta * u = \Box E_+ * u = E_+ * \Box u = E_+ * 0 = 0, \]
    %
    where these convolutions are well defined precisely because of the support of all the quantities involved.
\end{proof}

The reflection of the forward fundamental solution about the origin $t = 0$ is another fundamental solution to the wave equation, which we denote by $E_-$. It is supported on the interior of the backward light cone, and called the \emph{backward fundamental solution}. Taking convex combinations of these fundamental solutions gives a plethora of other fundamental solutions, like the solution
%
\[ E_{\text{FW}} = \frac{E_+ + E_-}{2}, \]
%
the \emph{Feynman-Wheeler} fundamental solution.

Using the Fourier transform, we can write
%
\[ E_+(x,t) = \frac{H(t)}{2 \pi} \int \frac{\sin(2 \pi t |\xi|)}{|\xi|} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi. \]
%
Modifying this formula gives Fourier expressions for the backward fundamental solution, and the Feynman-Wheeler fundamental solution. We also have a solution of the form
%
\[ E_F(t,x) = \frac{1}{4 \pi i} \int e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot x + |t \xi|)}\; \frac{d\xi}{|\xi|}\; d\xi, \]
%
the \emph{Feynman fundamental solution}. This fundamental solution has the quirk that
%
\[ \text{supp}(E_F) = \RR^d_x \times \RR_t, \]
%
which is counterintuitive given the finite propogation speed of the wave equation.

Let us use these fundamental solutions to solve the Cauchy problem for the wave equation.

\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $f,g \in C^\infty(\RR^d)$, and $F \in C^\infty(\RR^d \times [0,\infty))$. Then the Cauchy problem
    %
    \[ \Box u(x,t) = F(x,t) \]
    %
    with $u(0,t) = f(x)$ and $\partial_t u(x,0) = g(x)$ has a unique solution in $C^\infty(\RR^d \times [0,\infty))$, and we can write this solution as
    %
    \[ u(t) = \partial_t E_+(t) * f + E_+(t) * g + \int_0^t E_+(t-s) * F(s)\; ds. \]
    %
    If we assume $f,g \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$, and $F \in C^\infty(\RR_t, \mathcal{S}(\RR^d_x))$, then we can also write
    %
    \[ u(x,t) = \cos(2 \pi t \sqrt{-\Delta}) f + \frac{\sin(2 \pi t \sqrt{-\Delta})}{\sqrt{-\Delta}} g + \int_0^t \frac{\sin(2 \pi (t - s) \sqrt{-\Delta})}{\sqrt{-\Delta}} F(s)\; ds. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The Fourier multiplier formula follows from the Fourier expression of $E_+$. The expression above is well defined since $\partial_t E_+(t)$ and $E_+(t)$ are smooth functions of $t$ valued in $\mathcal{E}^*(\RR^d)$. Now
    %
    \[ \Box E_+(t) = \Box \partial_t E_+(t) = 0 \]
    %
    for $t > 0$, so it is clear that $v(t) = \partial_t E_+(t) * f + E_+(t) * g$ solves the wave equation for $t > 0$. Since $(E_+)(0+) = 0$, and $(\partial_t E_+)(0+) = \delta_0$, $v(t)$ has the required initial conditions, so would solve the equation provided there were no forcing term. Thus it suffices to show that
    %
    \[ w(t) = \int_0^t E_+(t-s) * F(s)\; ds \]
    %
    solves the equation $\Box w = F$, with vanishing initial conditions. Now since $E_+(0+) = 0$,
    %
    \[ \partial_t w(t) = \int_0^t (\partial_t E_+)(t - s) * F(s)\; ds \]
    %
    and since $\partial_t E_+(0+) = \delta_0$,
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \partial_t^2 w(t) &= F(t) + \int_0^t (\partial_t^2 E_+)(t - s) * F(s)\; ds.\\
        &= F(t) + \int_0^t (\Delta E_+)(t - s) * F(s)\; ds\\
        &= F(t) + \Delta w(t).
    \end{align*}
    %
    Thus $\Box w = F$. It is clear from the above formulas that $w(0+) = \partial_t w(0+) = 0$. Thus we proved the \emph{existence} of solutions to the wave equation. Uniqueness follows from our uniqueness argument that $E_+$ is the unique fundamental solution, since it suffices to show that there is no nonzero $u \in C^\infty(\RR^d \times [0,\infty))$ with $\Box u = 0$ and with vanishing initial conditions.
\end{proof}

In order to construct fundamental solutions to the wave equation on a Riemannian manifold, it is helpful to note that we can find constants $\{ a_\nu : \nu \geq 1 \}$ such that if
%
\[ E_\nu(x,t) = a_\nu \cdot H(t) \cdot \text{Im} \left\{ |x|^2 - (t + i0)^2 \right\}^{\nu - \frac{d-1}{2}} \] 
%
then $\Box E_\nu = \nu E_{\nu - 1}$, where $E_0 = E_+$. The precise quantities $\{ a_\nu \}$ are difficult to calculate; the most convenient precise description of the distribution is that given by the equation
%
% TODO: Possibly multiples of 2pi in this formula
\[ E_\nu(x,t) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \nu! \int_{\RR^{d+1}} e^{2 \pi i (x \cdot \xi + t \tau)} (|\xi|^2 - (\tau - i \varepsilon)^2)^{-\nu - 1}\; d\xi\; d\tau, \]
%
i.e. the spacetime Fourier transform of the function $(\xi,\tau) \mapsto (|\xi|^2 - (\tau - i 0)^2)^{-\nu - 1}$. This function is holomorphic on the upper half plane, so Paley-Wiener implies that $\text{supp}_t(E_\nu) \subset [0,\infty)$, and it is fairly simple to check that $E_0$, as we have defined it here, is a fundamental solution to the wave equation, so that the uniqueness result we proved above for the fundamental solution implies that $E_+ = E_0$. One then verifies that $\Box E_\nu = \nu E_{\nu - 1}$ quite simply. We note also the two formulas
%
\[ \nabla E_\nu(x,t) = (-1/2) x E_{\nu - 1} \quad\text{and}\quad \partial_t E_\nu(x,t) = (1/2) t E_{\nu-1}. \]
%
As $\nu \to \infty$, the distributions $\{ E_\nu \}$ become less and less singular on the forward light cone. By induction, using the recurrence formula
%
\[ E_\nu(x,t) = \nu \int_0^t \frac{\sin(2 \pi (t - s) |\xi|)}{|\xi|} \widehat{E}_{\nu-1}(\xi,s)\; d\xi\; ds, \]
%
we can write $E_\nu$ is a finite linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ t^j H(t) \int \frac{e^{2 \pi i (x \cdot \xi + t |\xi|)}}{|\xi|^{\nu + k + 1}}\; d\xi \]
%
where $j$ and $k$ range over non-negative integers satisfying $j + k = \nu$. In particular, we see from this formula that $E_\nu$ is a Lagrangian distribution of order at most $d/4 - \nu - 1$ on $\RR^{d+1}$.

% H(t) W_s homogeneous of order s.
% s = nu
% Then the spacetime Fourier transform is homogeneous of order -s - 2
% And we have s > 0
%
% mu = -nu - k - 1
% p = d
% m = -nu - k - 1 + d/4
%
% Spacetime Fourier transform is homogeneous of order $-2(nu + 1)$
%
% Symbol of order -nu -k - 1
% mu = -nu - k - 1
% m = mu - d/4 + 1/2
% m = -nu - 1/2 - d/4
%
% Phase function is phi(x,t,y,xi) = d_g(x,y) tau + t |tau|
%       or d_g(x,y) tau - t |tau|
%       Stationary when d_g(x,y) = |t|
%   Then nabla_x phi is tau times the unit tangent vector at x pointing away from y
%   Then nabla_y phi is tau times the unit tangent vector at y pointing away from x
%   Then nabla_t phi = |tau|
%       Away from tau = 0, phase function
%  
% Nondegeneracy:
%   When d_g(x,y) = |t|
%       nabla_tau = d_g(x,y) - t sgn(tau)
%       D_t nabla_tau = - sgn(tau)
%   So has rank one, nondegenerate.
%
% So Lagrangian manifold is precisely the conormal to the light cone.

\section{Constant Coefficient Metric}

Now let's move on to the case of the wave equation on $\RR^{d+1}$, where $\RR^d$ is equipped with a different, constant-coefficient metric $g = \sum g_{ij} dx^i dx^j$. The Laplace-Beltrami operator then becomes
%
\[ \Delta_g f = \sum_{i,j} g^{ij} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} = \nabla \cdot \nabla_g f. \]
%
Let $G$ denote the positive definite $d \times d$ matrix with coefficients $g_{ij}$. Then
%
\[ \nabla_g f = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} g^{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} = G^{-1} \cdot \nabla f. \]
%
Consider a new coordinate system $y = Tx$ for some invertible linear operator $T: \RR^d \to \RR^d$. The chain rule implies that 
%
\[ \nabla_g (T^* f) = G^{-1} \cdot \nabla (T^* f) = (G^{-1} T^t) (\nabla f \circ T). \]
%
Thus
%
\begin{align*}
    \Delta_g(T^* f) &= \nabla \cdot \nabla_g f\\
    &= \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \left\{ (G^{-1} T^t)_{ij} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y^j} \circ T \right) \right\}\\
    &= \sum_{k,i,j} T_{ki} (G^{-1} T^t)_{ij} \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^k \partial y^j} \circ T\\
    &= \sum_{k,j} (TG^{-1} T^t)_{kj} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^k \partial y^j}.
\end{align*}
%
If we choose $T$ such that $TG^{-1}T^t = I$, which happens precisely when $G = T^t T$, then we obtain that
%
\[ \Delta_g (T^* f) = T^*(\Delta f), \]
%
where $\Delta f$ is the Euclidean Laplacian of $h$.
%For smooth functions $u$ on $\RR^{d+1}$, with $u(x,t) = v(Tx,t)$, we thus have
%
%\[ \Box_g u = \Box v \circ T. \]
%
Now let $E$ denote the forward fundamental solution to $\Box$ on $\RR^{d+1}$. Let $F: \RR^{d+1} \to \RR^{d+1}$ given by $F(x,t) = F(Tx, t)$. Noting that $\det(T) = \det(G)^{1/2}$, if we set
%
\[ E_0 = \det(G)^{1/2} F^* E, \]
%
i.e. so that
%
\[ E_0(x,t) = \det(G)^{1/2} E(Tx,t) = H(t) \frac{c_d \det(G)^{1/2}}{\text{Im}( |x|_g^2 - (t + i0)^2 )^{\frac{d-1}{2}}}, \]
%
then $\Box_g E_0 = \delta$. Indeed, for $\phi \in \DD(\RR^{d+1})$, a change of variables tells us that
%
\begin{align*}
    ( \Box_g E_0, \phi ) &= \det(G)^{1/2} \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \Big( \Box_g F^* E_\varepsilon, \phi \Big)\\
    &= \det(G)^{1/2} \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \iint \Box_g (F^* E_\varepsilon)(x,t)\; \phi(x,t)\; dx\; dt\\
    &= \det(G)^{1/2} \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \iint (\Box E_\varepsilon)(Tx,t)\; \phi(x,t)\; dx\; dt\\
    &= \det(G)^{1/2} \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \det(T)^{-1} \iint (\Box E_\varepsilon)(y,t)\; \phi(T^{-1} y, t)\; dy\; dt\\
    &= \det(G)^{1/2} \det(T)^{-1} \phi(T^{-1} 0, 0)\\
    &= \phi(0,0).
\end{align*}
%
Thus we've found a fundamental solution.

%
%To determine the behaviour of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, let's see how the metric changes under a \emph{linear change of coordinates}. Fix an invertible linear map $T: \RR^d \to \RR^d$. Then we can consider a new metric $T_* g$ given by
%
%\[ \langle v, w \rangle_{T_* g} = \langle T^{-1} v, T^{-1} w \rangle_g. \]
%
%But then
%
%\[ \langle v, w \rangle_{T_* g} = (T^{-1} v)^t G (T^{-1} w) = v^t (T^{-t} G T^{-1}) w. \]
%
%If $G = T^t T$, then we have $\langle v, w \rangle_{T_* g} = v^t w$, i.e. $T_* g$ is the standard Euclidean metric. This is true, for instance, if $T = G^{1/2}$, or more generally, if we consider the \emph{Cholesky decomposition} of $G$, where $T$ is lower triangle with strictly positive entries on the diagonal.
%
%For any differential operator $L$ defined on functions on $\RR^d$, define $(T_* L) f = L(f \circ T) \circ T^{-1}$. The chain rule implies that
% T^{-1}_k = sum T^{-1}_{kn} x_n
%\[ (T_* \Delta_g) f = \sum_{k,l} (T G^{-1} T^t)_{kl} \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^k \partial x^l} \right) = \Delta f, \]
%
%i.e. $T_* \Delta_g = \Delta$. But this means that $\Delta_g(f \circ T) = T^*(\Delta f)$. More generally, for functions $u$ on $\RR^{d + 1}$, if $\Box_g = \partial_t^2 - \Delta_g$, then
%
%\[ \Box_g(u \circ T) = T^* \Box u. \]
%
%Thus in particular, if $E_{+,0}$ is the forward fundamental solution to the wave equation in the standard metric, then
%
%\[ \Box_g(E_{+,0} \circ T) = T^* \delta = |g|^{-1/2} \delta. \]
%
%Thus the \emph{forward fundamental solution} to $\Delta_g$ is
%
%\[ E_+(x,t) = \frac{c_d H(t)}{\text{Im}(|x|_g^2 - (t + i0)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}}, \]
%
%in the sense that for any test function $\phi \in \DD(\RR^{d+1})$,
%
%\[ \int_{\RR^{d+1}} E_+ \cdot \Box_g \phi\; dV_g = \phi(0,0), \]
%
%where we note we are now integrating with respect to the \emph{volume form} $dV_g = |g|^{1/2} dx$ rather than the Lebesgue measure.
Analogous to the behaviour of the forward fundamental solution with respect to the standard metric, the fundamental solution here has support on the interior of the light cone, i.e. the set
%
\[ \{ (x,t) \in \RR^{d+1}: t \geq 0\ \text{and}\ |x|_g \leq t \}. \]
%
We also have a Fourier transform representation of this fundamental solution, namely, $E_0$ is given by an oscillatory integral distribution of the form
% T^t xi = xi'
% dxi' = det(T) dxi
\begin{align*}
    E_0(x,t) &= H(t) \int \frac{\sin(2 \pi t |\xi|)}{2 \pi |\xi|} e^{2 \pi i T^t \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi\\
    &= H(t) \int \det(G)^{-1/2} \frac{\sin(2 \pi t |\xi|_g)}{2 \pi |\xi|_g} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi.
\end{align*}
%
Thus in particular, for $\phi \in \DD(\RR^d \times \RR)$, we have
%
\[ \int E_0(x,t) \phi(x,t)\; dV_g(x)\; dt = \int_0^\infty \iint \phi(x,t) \frac{\sin(2 \pi t |\xi|_g)}{2 \pi |\xi|_g} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; dx\; d\xi\; dt. \]
%
This is somewhat `coordinate invariant', because the left hand side is given by integration with respect to the Riemannian volume measure, which changes nicely in coordinates, and the right hand side is given by integration against the natural Louiville volume measure $dx\; d\xi$ defined on $\RR^n_x \times \RR^n_\xi$.

% xi' = T^{-t} xi
% dxi' = det(T^{-t}) dxi
%i.e. if $y = Mx$ for some invertible $d \times d$ matrix $M$. Then if
%
%\[ \sum a^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} = \sum b^i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}, \]
% y^i = sum M^i_j x^j
%then $a = M^{-1}b$. But this implies that if
%
%\[ X = \sum v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} \quad\text{and}\quad Y = \sum w^i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}, \]
%
%then
%
%\[ \langle X, Y \rangle_g = (M^{-1} v)^t G (M^{-1} w) = v^t (M^{-T} G M^{-1}) w. \]
%
%In particular, if we pick $M = G^{1/2}$, then $M^{-T} G M^{-1} = G^{-1/2} G G^{-1/2}$ is the identity matrix, and so the metric can be identified with the standard Euclidean metric in the coordinates $y$.
%This coordinate formula allows us to find fundamental solutions for the wave equation $\Box_g = \partial_t^2 - \Delta_g$. The calculations above imply that the forward fundamental solution on $\RR^d$ obtained by integrating in the coordinates $y$ is precisely the forward fundamental solution for the standard wave equation. The change of variables formula implies that if $y = Mx$ with $M = G^{1/2}$ as above, and if $f(y,t) = g(x,t)$, then
%
%\begin{align*}
%    \int E_+(y,t) f(y,t)\; dy &= |g|^{1/2} \int E_+(Mx,t) g(x,t)\; dx.
%\end{align*}
%
%Thus we find that, integrating against the $x$ coordinates, the fundamental solution is
%
%\[ E_+(x,t) = |g|^{1/2} E_+(G^{1/2} x, t) = \frac{c_d H(t)}{\text{Im}(|x|_g^2 - (t + i0)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}}. \]
%
%Other quantities we calculated above can be converted to these coordinates. In particular, we see that the forward fundamental solution is supported on the interior of the forward light cone with respect to the metric $g$, i.e. the set $\{ (x,t): t > 0\ \text{and}\ |x|_g \leq t \}$.
%
%Again, similar to the standard metric, we can construct distributions $E_\nu$
%Similarily, we can construct distributions $E_\nu$ with $E_0 = E_+$, and with $\Box_g E_\nu = \nu E_{\nu - 1}$, just by pulling back the same distributions in the Euclidean case. The distribution $E_\nu$ will be a finite linear combination of terms of the form
%
%\[ t^j H(t) \int e^{2 \pi i (x \cdot \xi + t |\xi|_g)} |\xi|_g^{-\nu - 1 - k} \]
%
%where $j + k = \nu$.

\section{General Riemannian Metric}

Let us now address the wave equation on a general Riemannian manifold $M$. Because we have a non-constant coefficient equation, we cannot expect to obtain a fundamental solution, instead only a \emph{parametrix}, which gives a solution \emph{modulo smoothing terms}. More precisely, let $r_0$ be the \emph{injectivity radius} of $M$, defined in subsequent paragraphs. If $\delta$ and $t_0$ are positive numbers with $t_0 + \delta < r_0$, and if we set $I_0 = \{ t : |t| < t_0 \}$, then we will construct a Schwartz operator $T_H$ from $M$ to $I_0 \times M$ such that the operator $\Box_g \circ T_H$ has a kernel lying in $C^\infty(I_0 \times M \times M)$. The operator $T_H$ is called the \emph{Hadamard parametrix}.

Let us start by introducing \emph{normal coordinates}, which is where the injectivity radius enters the picture. Namely, $r_0$ is the largest quantity such that for all $r < r_0$, for a point $q \in M$, and if $B$ is the radius $r$ ball centered at the origin in $T_{q} M$ (defined with respect to the metric on $T_{q} M$ induced by $g$), the geodesic map $\exp_{q}: B \to M$ is well-defined and a diffeomorphism. The image is then the metric ball
%
\[ B_r(q) = \{ p \in M: d_g(p,q) < r \}. \]
%
Let us fix $q \in M$. If we fix an arbitrary orthonormal basis on $T_{q} M$, then we obtain an isomorphism $T_p M \cong \RR^d$, and we call the induced diffeomorphism $x$ from $B_\delta(q)$ to the ball $B$ of radius $\delta$ in $\RR^d$ a system of \emph{normal coordinates} at $q$.

Let's review some useful properties of this correspondence. In the coordinate system $x$, we can write the Riemannian metric as
%
\[ \sum g_{ij}(x) dx^i dx^j \]
%
for smooth functions $\{ g_{ij}(x) \}$ giving th coefficients of a symmetric matrix $G(x)$. The fact that we have used geodesic normal coordinates means the matrices $\{ G(x) \}$ have two useful properties:
%
%As the tangent space of a Riemannian manifold, $T_q M$ is naturally an inner product space, and we shall denote the inner product of two vectors $v,w \in T_q M$ by $\langle v, w \rangle$. On the other hand, the diffeomorphism $B \to B_\varepsilon(q)$ gives $B \subset T_q M$ a Riemannian metric, which we shall denote by $g$. The tangent space $TB$ is naturally identified with $B \times T_q M$, so for $a \in B$ it is natural to write an element of $T_a B$ by $v_a$, where $v$ is a vector in $T_q M$. The metric $g$ induces an inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_g$ on each of the tangent spaces $T_a B$, and this in turn induces a smooth family of positive-definite transformations $G(a): T_q M \to T_q M$ for $a \in B$ such that for $v,w \in T_q M$,
%
%\[ \langle v_a, w_a \rangle_g = \langle G(a) v, w \rangle. \]
%
%The fact that we are using geodesic normal coordinates here means the matrices $\{ G(a) : a \in B \}$ have several useful properties:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G(0)$ is the identity map.

    \item (The Gauss Lemma) For each $x \in B$, $G(x) x = G(0) x$.
\end{itemize}
%
These equations are key to the construction of the Hadamard parametrix, which we might predict given that the wave equation on Euclidean space propogates radially, and the Gauss Lemma tells us that in normal coordinates, the Riemannian metric behaves like the Euclidean metric in the radial direction.

In coordinates, if we write
%
\[ \nabla_g f = \sum_{i,j} g^{ij} (\partial_j f) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}, \]
%
then the Laplace-Beltrami operator can be written as
%
\[ \Delta_g f = |g|^{-1/2} \nabla \cdot (|g|^{1/2} \nabla_g f). \]
%
Using the product rule, we can write $\Delta_g f = L_g f + R_g f$, where
%
\[ L_g f = \text{Div}(\nabla_g f) \quad\text{and}\quad R_g f = X \cdot \nabla f, \]
%
and
%
\[ X = |g|^{-1/2} \sum\nolimits_{i,j} \partial_i \{ |g|^{1/2} g^{ij} \} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}. \]
%
We first claim that if we consider
%
\[ E_0(x,t) = H(t) \frac{c_d}{\text{Im}(|x|^2 - (t + i0)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}}, \]
%
then, restricted to $B \times I_0$, $(\partial_t^2 - L_g) E_0 = \delta$.

\begin{comment}

For any $\phi \in \DD(B)$, define
%
\[ (\nabla_g \phi)(x) = \sum g^{ij}(x) \partial_j \phi(x) e_i = G(x)^{-1} \nabla \phi(x), \]
%
and for $X \in \DD(B,\RR^d)$,
%
\[ (\text{div}_g X)(x) = |G|^{-1/2}\; \nabla \cdot \{ |G|^{1/2} X \}. \]
%
If, for $\phi \in \DD(B)$, we set $\Delta_g \phi = \text{div}_g ( \nabla_g \phi )$, then
%
\[ \Delta_g (\phi \circ x) = (\Delta_g \phi) \circ x. \]
%
Similarily, if we define $\Box_g = \partial_t^2 - \Delta_g$ for elements of $\DD(B \times \RR)$, then
%
\[ \Box_g ( \phi \circ x ) = (\Box_g \phi) \circ x. \]
%
All the operators above are linear differential operators with smooth coefficients, and thus extend by duality to operators defined on distributions on $B$. If we define
%
\[ \nabla_g^* X = - \sum_{i,j} \partial_j \left\{ g^{ij} X_i \right\} = - \nabla \cdot G^{-1} X; \]
%
and
%
\[ \text{div}_g^* \phi = - |G|^{1/2} \nabla \{ |G|^{-1/2} \phi \}, \]% = - \left( \nabla \phi + X_G \phi \right), \]
%
Then for a distribution $u$, and a vector-valued distribution $v$,
%
\[ ( \nabla_g u, X ) = ( u, \nabla_g^* X ) \quad\text{and}\quad ( \text{div}_g(v), Y ) = ( v, \text{div}_g^* Y ). \]
%
Now let's construct the Hadamard parametrix.

For a distribution $u \in \DD(B)^*$, if we write
%
\[ a_G = |G|^{-1/2} G^{-1} \nabla \{ |G|^{1/2} \}, \]
%
then we can apply the product rule to write
%
\begin{align*}
    \Delta_g u &= \text{div}_g(\nabla_g u)\\

We will be able to deal with the second-order differential operator $L$ using the radial symmetry of the metric (i.e. via the Gauss Lemma), whereas we will be able to deal with the first-order differential operator $R$ using an asymptotic expansion.

\end{comment}

We begin with a computation involving smooth functions. If $E \in C^\infty(B)$ is smooth and \emph{radial}, with $E(x) = F(|x|^2)$, then we claim that
%
\[ (\nabla_g E)(x) = 2 x F'(|x|^2) = (\nabla E)(x). \]
%
The nontrivial part is proving the first inequality, which follows by the Gauss Lemma because
%
\begin{align*}
    (\nabla_g E)(x) &= G(x)^{-1} \{ (\nabla E)(x) \}\\
    &= G(x)^{-1} \left( 2x F'(|x|^2) \right)\\
    &= 2 F'(|x|^2) G(x)^{-1} x\\
    &= 2 F'(|x|^2) x.
\end{align*}
%
By taking weak limits, we conclude that $\nabla_g E = \nabla E$ for any distribution $E$ that is a weak limit of radial functions. We thus obtain the following result.

\begin{lemma}
    Consider the distribution $E_{0,q}$ on $M \times I_0$, such that $\text{supp}(E_{0,q}) \subset B_\delta(q)$, and such that, with respect to the normal coordinate system $x: B_\delta(q) \to B$ constructed above, we have
    %
    \[ E_{0,q}(x,t) = H(t) \cdot \frac{c_d}{\text{Im} \left( |x|^2 - (t + i0)^2 \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}}. \]
    %
    Then $(\partial_t^2 - L_g) E_{0,q} = \delta_{q}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    In the normal coordinate system $x$, for each fixed $t$, $E_{0,q}(\cdot,t)$ is a radial function. Thus
    %
    \begin{align*}
        L_g E_{0,q} &= \text{Div}(\nabla_g E_{0,q}) = \text{Div}( \nabla E_{0,q} ) = \Delta E_{0,q} = \delta_{q}. \qedhere
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

We have constructed a fundamental solution for $L_g$, which gives the `second order terms' for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We must thus adjust our solution so that the `lower order terms' $R_g$ are also negligible, which will give us our parametrix. We note that, as in the Euclidean case, we can use similar ideas to the Lemma above to define distributions $E_{\nu,q}$ for all $\nu > 0$, such that
%
\[ (\partial_t^2 - L_g) \{ E_{\nu,q} \} = \nu E_{\nu-1,q}. \]
%
These distributions are just the Euclidean distributions $E_\nu$ when studied in normal coordinates about $q$. Our goal is now to recursively find a sequence of smooth functions $\{ \beta_\nu : \nu \geq 0 \}$ such that, for any $N \geq 0$, if we define
%
\[ S_{q,N}(x,t) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^N \beta_\nu(x) E_{\nu,q}(x,t), \]
%
then
%
\[ (\Box_g S_{q,N})(x,t) = \delta_{q} - (\Delta_g \beta_N)(x) E_{N,q}(x,t). \]
%
The distributions $E_{N,q}$ becomes increasingly smooth as $N \to \infty$, so we therefore construct an arbitrarily smooth approximation to a fundamental solution to the wave equation at $q$.

TODO: FIX THE COMMENTED OUT CALCULATIONS WHICH SHOW HOW TO FIND 

\begin{comment}

If we write
%
\[ F_\nu(x) = \frac{1}{\text{Im} ( |x|^2 - (t + i0)^2 )^{\frac{d-1}{2} + \nu}}, \]
%
then the Gauss Lemma argument given above shows that

As the main term, let us try and find a forward fundamental solution to the operator $\partial_t^2 - L$, i.e. to try and find a distribution $E_+$ such that $(\partial_t^2 - L) E_+ = \delta_0$. The trick to doing this is to note that a simple calculation, together with the Gauss Lemma, we conclude that for a smooth, \emph{radial} function $E \in C^\infty(B)$, with $E(x) = F(x \cdot x)$, we have
%
\[ (\nabla E)(x) = 2 x\; F'(x \cdot x) = \nabla_g E(x). \]
%
If $E_0: B \times \RR \to \CC$ is the forward fundamental solution to the wave equation on $\RR \times \RR^d$, then $E_0$ is the weak limit of operators of the form
%
\[ E_\varepsilon(x,t) = c_d \cdot \frac{H(t)}{\text{Im} \left\{ \left(|x|^2 - (t + i \varepsilon)^2 \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \right\}}. \]
%
We can write $E_\varepsilon(x,t) = F_\varepsilon(x \cdot x,t)$, and then it follows that
%
\begin{align*}
    (\partial_t^2 - L) E_0 &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (\partial_t^2 - L) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla_g) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla) E_0\\
    &= \Box E_0 = \delta.
\end{align*}
%
We therefore see that
%
\[ \Box_g E_0 = \delta - R E_0 = \delta - \Big\{ \text{First Order Terms} \Big\}. \]
%
We can do even between than this. Consider some radial, smooth function $\alpha_0: B \to \RR$ with $\alpha(0) = 1$, and $\alpha_0(x) = A(|x|^2)$. Let $(\nabla \alpha_0)(x) = x A(x \cdot x)$ and let $(\nabla E_0)(x) = x F_0(x \cdot x)$. Then
%
\begin{align*}
    \Box_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \} &= \alpha_0 \partial_t^2 E_0 - \left[ L \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \} + R \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \} \right]\\
    &= \alpha_0 (\partial_t^2 E_0 - L E_0) - \left[ (\Delta_g \alpha_0) E_0 + 2 (\nabla \alpha_0 \cdot \nabla E_0) + \alpha_0 R E_0 \right]\\
    &= \alpha_0 \cdot \delta - [ (\Delta_g \alpha_0) E_0 + 2 F_0(|x|^2) \left( 2 A'(|x|^2) |x|^2 + A(|x|^2) (a_G \cdot x) \right) ] 
\end{align*}
%
TODO: KEEP PERFORMING THIS CALCULATION.

We can thus find functions


Recall the distributions $\{ E_\nu : \nu \geq 1 \}$ defined in the Euclidean construction. An analogous argument as above shows that, since these distributions are all radial, for $\nu \geq 1$ we have
%
\[ (\partial_t^2 - L) E_\nu = \nu E_{\nu - 1}. \]
%
If we can find smooth functions $\{ \alpha_\nu : \nu \geq 1 \}$ such that
%
\[ (\partial_t^2 - L) \alpha_\nu E_\nu \]



Our goal is now to find additional distributions $\{ E_\nu : \nu \geq 1 \}$ and smooth functions $\{ \alpha_\nu: B \times B \to \CC \}$ such that
%
\[  \]

We can now add on quantities to $E_0$ such that $(\partial_t^2 - L)$



%
\[ ( \Delta_g ) \]

For any $\phi \in \DD(B)$, we have
%
\[ \nabla_g \{ (\phi \circ x) \} \]

For any $\phi \in \DD(B)$, write
%
\[ x_*(\nabla_g (\phi \circ x)|_p ) = L_{\nabla_g} \phi \]

$\nabla_g \{ \phi \circ \Lambda \}$

$\Box_g \{ \phi \circ \Lambda \} = A \phi \circ \Lambda$, 


As an inner product space, the space $T_q M$, and thus $B \subset T_q M$, comes equipped with a natural normalization of the Lebesgue measure, which we will denoted by standard symbols such as $da$. But the Riemannian metric on $B$ also gives it a volume form, which we denote by $dV_g$. Note that we can write $dV_g = |G|^{1/2} da$, where $|G|$ denotes the determinants of the transformations $G$ defined above. There is a slightly notational problem here, since a smooth function $\phi$ can be identified with two distributions on $B$, depending on whether we test against the Lebesgue measure or the volume form; to avoid confusion, we denote the two different distributions as $\phi\; da$ and $\phi\; dV_g$ respectively.

Similarily, the inner product structure on $T_q M$ gives it a gradient operator $\nabla$, taking functions $f: B \to \CC$ to vector fields $\nabla f: B \to T_q M$. If we consider the Riemannian gradient $\nabla_g f: B \to T_q M$ taken with respect to the Riemannian metric on $B$, then $\nabla_g f = G^{-1} \nabla f$. Similarily, for a vector field $v: B \to T_q M$, we can consider the divergence $\nabla \cdot v: B \to \CC$, such that for smooth $f: B \to \CC$ supported on a compact subset of $B$,
%
\[ \int_B (\nabla \cdot v)(x) f(x)\; dx = - \int_B v(x) \cdot \nabla f(x)\; dx. \]
%
We then have
%
\[ \nabla_g \cdot v = |G|^{-1/2}\; \nabla \cdot \{ |G|^{1/2} v \}. \]
%
By applying duality here, we can define distributional variants of these derivatives.

% In coordinates, the operator
% L_j = sum_{j,k} g^{jk}(x) partial_k(x)
%       defined with restrict to the measure da
% Then
%   L_j^* = - sum_{j,k} partial_k { g^{jk} phi }
% and ( L_j u, phi ) = ( u, L_j phi )

Now let's start constructing the Hadamard parametrix. Applying the product rule, for $f: B \to \CC$, we have
%
\begin{align*}
    \Delta_{g_B} f &= \nabla_g \cdot \nabla_g f\\
    &= |G|^{-1/2} \left( \nabla \cdot \{ |G|^{1/2} \nabla_{g_B} f \} \right)\\
    &= \nabla \cdot \nabla_{g_B} f + |G|^{-1/2} \nabla |G|^{1/2} \cdot \nabla_{g_B} f\\
    &= \nabla \cdot \nabla_{g_B} f + v \cdot \nabla_{g_B} f\\
    &= Lf + Rf,
\end{align*}
%
where $v = |G|^{-1/2} \nabla |G|^{1/2}$. We view $Lf = \nabla \cdot \nabla_g f$ as a kind of `constant coefficient' second order operator, and $R f = \langle v, \nabla_g f \rangle_g$ as a kind of a `non-constant coefficient' first order operator.

TODO: The `non-constant coefficient' first order equation disappears when $|G|$ is constant on $B$ -- what does this tell us about the geodesic flow on $M$? Some kind of volume preservation?

Roughly speaking, the first order operator in the decomposition above is precisely the problem with constructing a true fundamental solution. If we could make them disappear, then it would be easy to construct a fundamental solution for small times. Indeed, consider the distribution on $B \times \RR$ given by
%
\[ E(a,t) = c_d \cdot \frac{H(t)}{\text{Im} \left\{ (|a|^2_g - (t + i0)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \right\} }, \]
%
defined by taking the weak limit of the distributions $E_\varepsilon dV_g$, where $E_\varepsilon$ is the smooth function on $B \times \RR$ given by the formula
%
\[ E_\varepsilon(a,t) = c_d \cdot \frac{H(t)}{\text{Im} \left\{ (|a|^2_g - (t + i\varepsilon)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \right\} }. \]
%
We have argued in the previous section that $\Box E = \delta$, where $\Box = \partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla$ is the d'Alembertian taken with respect to the constant metric on $B \subset T_q M$. We claim that in general, this remains true when we replace the constant metric on $B$ with the metric $g$, i.e. for $|t| < r_0 - r$, we have
%
\[ (\partial_t^2 - L_g) E(x,t) = \delta. \]
%
Disregarding the operator $R_g$, we see we have essentially constructed a fundamental solution to $\Box_g$ for small times.

To check this claim, consider $f \in C^\infty(B)$ of the form
%
\[ f(a) = F \Big( |a|^2 \Big), \]
%
where $F \in C^\infty(\RR)$. Choosing an arbitrary radial coordinate system in $T_q M$, and using the Gauss Lemma, it is simple to prove that for $a \in B$,
%
\[ \nabla f(a) = 2a\; F'(|a|^2) = \nabla_g f(a). \]
%
If we write $E_\varepsilon(a,t) = F_\varepsilon(|a|^2)$ for some smooth function $F$, then for any smooth, compactly supported vector field $X$ on $B$, again using the Gauss Lemma, we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \Big( \nabla E , X \Big) &= - \Big(  E , \nabla \cdot X \Big)\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} - \int E_\varepsilon\; (\nabla \cdot X)\; da\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int \Big\langle \nabla E_\varepsilon, X \Big\rangle\; da\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int \Big\langle \nabla_g E_\varepsilon, X \Big\rangle\; da\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int \Big\langle \nabla_g E_\varepsilon, X \Big\rangle_g\; da\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int \Big\langle \nabla_g E_\varepsilon, |G|^{-1/2} X \Big\rangle_g\; dV_g(a)\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int E_\varepsilon\; \nabla_g \cdot \{ |G|^{-1/2} X \}\; dV_g(a)
\end{align*}
% ( \nabla_g E, X ) = - ( E, nabla_g * X )
%                   = - int E_e (nabla_g . X) da
%                   = - int |G|^{-1/2} E_e (nabla_g . X) dV
%                   = int < nabla_g |G|^{-1/2} E_e, X >_g
%                   = ( nabla E, X ) + (E, < nabla_g |G|^{-1/2} X >) int nabla_g |G|^{-1/2}



But then, taking $E$ as the limit of $E_\varepsilon$, with respect to the normalized Lebesgue measure on $T_qM$, and writing $E_\varepsilon(a,t) = F_\varepsilon(|a|^2, t)$, for smooth functions $F_\varepsilon$, then we conclude that for a test function $\phi$,
%
\begin{align*}
    (L E, \phi) &= (\nabla \cdot \nabla_{g_B} E, \phi)\\
    &= (E, \nabla_{g_B} \cdot \nabla \phi)\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int E_\varepsilon(a,t) (\nabla_{g_B} \cdot \nabla) \{ \phi \}(a,t)\; da\; dt\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int |G(a)|^{-1/2} E_\varepsilon(a,t) (\nabla_{g_B} \cdot \nabla) \{ \phi \}(a,t)\; dV_g(a)\; dt\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} - \int \langle \nabla \{ |G|^{-1/2} E_\varepsilon \}(a,t), \nabla \phi(a,t) \rangle_{g_B}\; dV_g(a)\; dt\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} - \int |G(a)|^{1/2} [ G(a) \nabla \{ |G|^{-1/2} E_\varepsilon \} ] \cdot \nabla \phi(a,t)\; da\; dt\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int \nabla \cdot \left\{ |G|^{1/2} G(a) \nabla \{ |G|^{-1/2} E_\varepsilon(a,t) \} \right\} \phi(a,t)\; da\; dt.
\end{align*}

But then if we take $E$ as the weak limit $E_\varepsilon$ of smooth, radial functions $\{ E_\varepsilon \}$ as we have done previously in this chapter, i.e. with $E_\varepsilon(x,t) = F_\varepsilon(|x|^2_{g_0}, t)$, and where the limit is taken with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $B$, then we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    ( L_g E, \phi ) &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int (L_g E_\varepsilon)(x,t) \\
    &= ( \partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla_{g_B} E, \phi )\\
    \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int \Box_{g_B} E_\varepsilon(x,t)\; dV_g(x)\; dt\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla_g) E_\varepsilon(x,t) \phi(x,t)\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int (\partial_t^2 - )
\end{align*}

 this identity gives that
%
\begin{align*}
    (\partial_t^2 - L_g) E &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (\partial_t^2 - L_g) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla_g) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} (\partial_t^2 - \nabla \cdot \nabla) E_\varepsilon\\
    &= (\partial_t^2 - \Box) E = \delta.
\end{align*}
%
Note that our calculations require us to work in a normal coordinate system, which makes the radial behaviour of the wave equation play nicely.

\begin{lemma}
    If we are working in a normal coordinate system, then
    %
    \[ \nabla_{g(0)} f = \nabla_g f. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We calculate using the chain rule that
    % sum g_{ij} x^i x^j
    \begin{align*}
        \nabla_{g(0)} f &= G(0)^{-1} (\nabla_x f)\\
        &= 2 F'(|x|^2_{g(0)}) x
    \end{align*}
    %
    and (now using the normal coordinate equation)
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \nabla_g f(x) &= G(x)^{-1} (\nabla_x f)\\
        &= 2 F'(|x|^2_{g(0)}) [G(x)^{-1} G(0)] x\\
        &= 2 F'(|x|^2_{g(0)}) [G(x)^{-1} G(x)] x\\
        &= 2 F'(|x|^2_{g(0)}) x.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Comparing calculations shows we have equality.
\end{proof}

More generally, our calculations imply that if we define
%
\[ E_\nu(a,t) = a_\nu \cdot H(t) \cdot \text{Im} \Big(|a|^2_g - (t + i0)^2 \Big)^{\nu - \frac{d-1}{2}}, \]
%
on $T_q M$, defined with respect to the measure $dx$, then $(\partial_t^2 - L_g) E_\nu = \nu E_{\nu-1}$ for $\nu \geq 1$. We now use these distributions to fix the fundamental solution for $\partial_t^2 - L_g$ that we constructed above, to obtain the Hadamard parametrix for $\Delta_g$.

%Indeed, we claim that, \emph{if we are working in normal coordinates}, and we let
%
%\[ E_0(x,t) = \frac{c_d H(t)}{\text{Im}(|x|^2_{g(0)} - (t + i0)^2)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}}, \]
%
%then for small times $t$,
%
%\[ (\partial_t^2 - L_g) E(x,t) = |g(0)|^{-1/2} \delta, \]
%
%where $g(0$ is the metric at the origin. The restriction of times is required in particular so that, by finite propogation speed, $\text{supp}_x(E)$ is compactly contained in $B$.

%To verify this identity, fix a function $F \in C^\infty(\RR)$, and we define
%
%\[ f(x) = F( |x|_{g(0)}^2 ), \]
%
%then $(L_{g(0)} f)(x) = (L_g f)(x)$ for $x$ in a suitably small neighborhood of the origin. This follows from showing that if we define the differential operator $A_g = \sum_i g^{ij} \partial_j$, then

%But we calculate that
%
%\begin{align*}
%    L_{g(0)} f &= \sum g(0)^{jk} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}\\
%    &= F'( |x|^2_{g(0)} ) \sum g(0)^{jk} \frac{\partial^2 |x|^2_{g(0)}}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}\\
%    &= F'( |x|^2_{g(0)} ) \sum g(0)^{jk} (2 g(0)_{jk})
%\end{align*}
%TODO: Check this calculation, e.g. in Sogge Chapter 2. More generally, if we define
%
%\[ E_\nu(x,t) = |g(0)|^{1/2} a_\nu H(t) \text{Im}(|x|^2 - (t + i0)^2)^{\nu - \frac{d-1}{2}}, \]
%
%then $(\partial_t^2 - L_g) E_\nu = \nu E_{\nu-1}$. We will use these higher order terms to correct for the $R_g$ terms we are missing.

Suppose $\beta_0 \in C^\infty(B)$. Suppose $E_\nu(x,t) = F_\nu(|x|_g^2,t)$. For $\nu = 0$, we can expand out $\Box_{g_B}$ to yield that
% |G|^{-1/2} nabla . nabla_g { alpha_0 E_0 }
% = 2 |G|^{-1/2}  < G(a)^{-1} nabla alpha_0, nabla E_0 >_g
\begin{align*}
    \Box_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 E_0 \} &= \beta_0 \partial_t^2 E_0 - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 E_0 \}\\
    &= \beta_0 \partial_t^2 E_0 - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 \} E_0 - \beta_0 \Delta_{g_B} \{ E_0 \} - 2 |G|^{-1/2} \langle G(a)^{-1} \nabla \beta_0, \nabla E_0 \rangle_g\\
    &= \beta_0 \delta_{0,0} - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 \} E_0 - \beta_0 R \{ E_0 \} - 2 |G|^{-1/2} \langle G(a)^{-1} \nabla \beta_0, \nabla E_0 \rangle_g\\
    &= \beta_0 \delta_{0,0} - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 \} E_0 - |G|^{-1/2} \langle \beta_0 \nabla |G|^{1/2} - 2 G(a)^{-1} \nabla \beta_0 , \nabla E_0 \rangle_g\\
    &= \beta_0 \delta_{0,0} - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 \} E_0 - 2 |G|^{-1/2} F_0' \cdot \langle \beta_0 \nabla |G|^{1/2} - 2 G^{-1} \nabla \beta_0 , a \rangle_g.
\end{align*}
%
Similarily, we have that for $a_\nu \in C^\infty(B)$,
%
\begin{align*}
    \Box_{g_B} \{ \beta_\nu E_\nu \} &= \beta_\nu \nu E_{\nu-1} - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_\nu \} E_\nu - 2 |G|^{-1/2} F_\nu' \langle \beta_\nu \nabla |G|^{1/2} - 2 G^{-1} \nabla \beta_\nu, a \rangle_g\\
    &= \beta_\nu \nu E_{\nu-1} - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_\nu \} E_\nu + |G|^{-1/2} a E_{\nu-1} \langle \beta_\nu \nabla |G|^{1/2} - 2 G^{-1} \nabla \beta_\nu, a \rangle_g.
\end{align*}
%
Suppose we can choose $\beta_0$ such that $\beta_0(0) = 0$, and $\beta_0 \nabla |G|^{1/2} = 2 G(a)^{-1} \nabla \beta_0$. Then
%
\[ \Box_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 E_0 \} = \delta_{0,0} - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_0 \} E_0. \]
%
If we successively choose $\{ \beta_\nu : \nu \geq 1 \}$ such that
%
\[ |G|^{-1/2} a \langle \beta_\nu \nabla |G|^{1/2} - 2 G^{-1} \nabla \beta_\nu, a \rangle_g = \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_{\nu-1} \}, \]
%
then, setting $F_N = \sum_{j = 1}^N \beta_j E_j$, we see that
%
\[ \Box_{g_B} F_N = \delta - \Delta_{g_B} \{ \beta_N \} E_{N+1}, \]
%
and we see that as $N \to \infty$, the difference between $\Box_{g_B} F_N$ and $\delta$ becomes smoother and smoother.

Now fix $t_0 < r_0 - r$. For each $\nu$, define $E_j(x,y)$


For each $q$, we have defined a distribution $F_N(q)$ on $B \times \{ |t| < t_0 \}$, such that $\text{supp}_B(S_N(q)) \Subset B$. By considering the pushforward diffeomorphism $\exp: B \to M$, we thus obtain a family of distributions $S_N(q)$ on $M \times \{ |t| < t_0 \}$. We can then define a distribution $K_{H,N}$ on $M \times \{ |t| < t_0 \} \times M$ such that $K_{H,N}(\cdot, \cdot, q) = S_n(q)$. It has the property that 
%
\[ \Box_{g,p} K_{H,N} = \delta_q - \Delta_g \{ \beta_N \} E_{N+1} \] 

Using the exponential map $\exp: B \to M$,

If we choose a orthogonal frame on some open neighborhood of the closure of an open set $U \subset M$, then this induces a smooth family of normal coordinate systems $x_q$. Since the objects constructed above depend smoothly on the Riemannian metric and coordinate system given, we can therefore find a family of distributions $E_\nu$ such that for $d(p,q) < \delta$, and if $\omega = f\; dx_q$ is an order one scalar density, then
%
\begin{align*}
    \int_M & E_\nu(p,q,t) \omega(p)\\
    &= c_{d,\nu} H(t) \int_{\RR^d} \frac{f( x_q^{-1}(x) )}{\text{Im} \left( |x|^2 - (t + i0)^2 \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2} + \nu}}\; dx.
\end{align*}
%
We can write this integral as a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\begin{align*}
    & t^j H(t) \int_{\RR^d} \int_{\RR^d} \frac{f( x_q^{-1}(x) )}{|\xi|^{\nu + k + 1}} e^{2 \pi i x \cdot \xi \pm t |\xi|}\; dx\; d\xi\\
    & \quad = t^j H(t) \int_0^\infty \int_{\RR^d} \rho^{d - \nu - k - 2} f( x_q^{-1}(x) ) B_d(\rho |x|) e^{\pm 2 \pi i \rho t}\; dx\; d\rho,
\end{align*}
%
which can in term be written as a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ t^j H(t) \int_0^\infty \int_{\RR^d} a(\rho |x|) \rho^{d - \nu - k - 2} f( x_q^{-1}(x) ) e^{2 \pi i \rho (\pm |x| \pm t)}\; dx\; d\rho, \]
%
where $a$ is a symbol of order $-(d-1)/2$. We can write this integral in a coordinate independent way as
%
\[ t^j H(t) \int_M \left( \int_0^\infty a( \rho d_g(p,q) ) \rho^{d - \nu - k - 2} e^{2 \pi i \rho (\pm d_g(p,q) \pm t)}\; d\rho \right) \omega(p)\; dp. \]
%
Thus the distribution $E_\nu$ can be written as a sum of terms given by oscillatory integrals of the form
%
\[ t^j \int_0^\infty a( \rho d_g(p,q) ) \rho^s e^{2 \pi i \rho ( \pm d_g(p,q) \pm t )}\; d\rho. \]
%
Let us rescale this integral as $t^j d_g(p,q)^{s-1}$ times
%
\[ \int_0^\infty a(\rho) \rho^s e^{2 \pi i \rho ( \pm d_g(p,q) \pm t )}\; d\rho. \]
%
Let us consider the integral over $\rho \leq 1$, i.e. an integral of the form
%
\[ t^j d_g(p,q)^{s-1} \int_0^\infty \chi(\rho) \rho^s e^{2 \pi i \rho ( \pm d_g(p,q) \pm t )}\; d\rho. \]
%
If $s \geq 1$, this integral is automatically a smoothing kernel by virtue of the fact that $\chi(\rho) \rho^s$ is a symbol of order $-\infty$. If $\rho \leq 1$, 

This is the Fourier transform of the function $\chi(\rho) \cdot \rho^s$, evaluated at the point $\mp d_g(p,q) \mp t$.



Modulo a smooth kernel, we may assume $a(\rho) = 0$ for $|\rho| \leq 1$.

Let us consider the composition of these integrals at two different times $t_0$ and $t_1$. This composition can be expressed as a sum of terms of the form
%
\[ t_0^{j_1} t_1^{j_2} \int_0^\infty a( \rho_1 d_g(p,a) ) a( \rho_2 d_g(a,q) ) \rho_1^{s_1} \rho_2^{s_2} e^{2 \pi i [\rho_1 ( \pm d_g(p,a) \pm t_1) + \rho_2 ( \pm d_g(a,q) \pm t_2 )]}\; da\; d\rho_0\; d\rho_1. \]
%
By finite speed of propogation, we need only integrate over values $a$ such that $d_g(p,a) \leq t_0$ and $d_g(a,q) \leq t_1$.





\[ \chi(P / R) = \int R \widehat{\chi}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P} \]
%
the kernel of this operator is thus a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ R^{-j_0} \int \int_0^\infty \widehat{\chi}(t_0) t_0^{j_0} \beta(d_g(p,q)) a( \rho_0 d_g(p,q) ) \rho_0^{s_0} e^{2 \pi i \rho_0 ( \pm d_g(p,q) \pm t_0 / R )}\; dt_0\; d\rho_0 \]
%
Write
%
\[ \alpha_0(t_0,p,q,\rho_0) = \widehat{\chi}(t_0) t_0^{j_0} \beta(d_g(p,q)) a( \rho_0 d_g(p,q) ) \rho_0^{s_0} \]
%
and
%
\[ \alpha_1(t,p,q,\rho_1) = a(\rho_1 d_g(p,q)) \rho_1^s. \]
%
Then the composition of $\chi(P/R)$ with our parametrix at time $t$ is a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ \int \alpha_1(t,p,a,\rho_1) \alpha_0(t_0,a,q,\rho_0) e^{2 \pi i [ \rho_1 ( \pm d_g(p,a) \pm t ) + \rho_0 ( \pm d_g(a,q) \pm t_0 / R )}\; dt_0\; d\rho_0\; d\rho_1\; da. \]
%
Suppose we localize $\rho_1$ to values $|\rho_1| \lesssim R$, i.e. we multiply by some function $\eta( \rho_1 / R)$. This is equivalent to consider a kernel of the form
%
\[ R \int \chi(\rho_1) \alpha_1(t,p,a, R \rho_1) \alpha_0(t_0,a,q,\rho_0) e^{2 \pi i [ R \rho_1 ( \pm d_g(p,a) \pm t ) + \rho_0 ( \pm d_g(a,q) \pm t_0 / R )}\; dt_0\; d\rho_0\; d\rho_1\; da. \]


If we now compose it with our parametrix, we find the kernel is a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ \int R \widehat{\chi}(Rt_0) t_0^{j'} H(t) \beta(d_g(a,q)) a(\rho_0 d_g(a,q)) \rho_0^{s'} e^{2 \pi i \rho_0 ( \pm d_g(a,q) \pm t_0 )} \; dt_0\; d\rho_0\; da \]


we get terms of the form
%
\[ t^{j + j'} H(t) \int_0^\infty R \widehat{\chi}(Rt') a( \rho_1 d_g(p,q) ) a(\rho_0 d_g(p,q)) \rho_1^s \rho_0^{s'} e^{2 \pi i [\rho_1 ( \pm d_g(p,q) \pm t ) + \rho_0(\pm d_g(p,q) \pm t')]} d\rho_1 d\rho_0 dt'. \]
%
If we have $|\rho_1| \lesssim R$ on the support of this integral,

If we assume that on the support of this integral, we either have $|\rho_1| \lesssim R$ or $|\rho_1| \gtrsim R$,

We can then write $S_N$ as a sum of terms of the form
%
\[ t^j H(t) \beta( p, q ) \int_0^\infty a( \rho d_g(p,q) ) \rho^s e^{2 \pi i \rho ( \pm d_g(p,q) \pm t )}\; d\rho. \]
%
At least on the sphere, by rotational symmetry of the geodesic flow, $\beta$ is a function of $d_g(p,q)$.




If we now define an operator $T_{H,N}$ on $\{ |t| < r_0 - r \} \times M$ to have Schwartz kernel $K_{H,N}$ on $M \times \{ |t| < r_0 - r \} \times M$, supported in
%
\[ \{ (p,t,q) : |t| < r_0 - r\ \text{and}\ d_g(p,q) < t \}, \]
%
and in the coordinates $B$ about $q$, agreeing with $S_N$, then we find that for smooth, compactly supported functions $f$ on $M$,
%
\[ \Box_g T_{H,N} f - \delta \otimes f \]
%
is a Lagrangian distribution of order $d/4 - N - 2$ on $\RR^{d+1}$, supported with the Lagrangian manifold given on the light cone. Applying asymptotics (TODO: ASK ANDREAS), modulo a smoothing operator, we can then find an operator $T_H$, whose Schwartz kernel is a Lagrangian distribution of order $d/4 - 1$, such that $\Box_g T_H f - \delta \otimes f$ is a smoothing operator. TODO: Applying this parametrix, we can construct a parametrix of $\cos(2 \pi t \sqrt{-\Delta_g})$, which is a Lagrangian distribution of order $d/4$.

\begin{comment}


%
%    &= (\partial_t^2 - L_g) \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \} - R_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \}\\
%    &= \alpha_0(0) \delta - \alpha_0 R_g \{ E_0 \} - L_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \}
%     \nabla_{g_0} \cdot \{ (\nabla_g \alpha_0) E_0 \} - \langle \nabla_g \alpha_0, \nabla_g E_0 \rangle_g - R_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \}\\
%    &= \alpha_0(0) \delta - \Delta_g \alpha_0 \cdot E_0 - 2 \langle \nabla_g \alpha_0, \nabla_g E_0 \rangle_g - R_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \}\\
%    &= \alpha_0(0) \delta - \langle \alpha_0 a + 2 \nabla_g \alpha_0, \nabla_g E_0 \rangle_g - (\Delta_g \alpha_0 + a \cdot \nabla_x \alpha_0) \cdot E_0.
%\end{align*}
%
We write
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle \alpha_0 a + 2 \nabla_g \alpha_0, \nabla_g E_0 \rangle_g &= 2 F_0'(|x|_g^2,t) \langle \alpha_0 a + 2 \nabla_g \alpha_0, x \rangle_g\\
    &= 2 F_0'(|x|_g^2,t) \left( \langle a, x \rangle_g \cdot \alpha_0 + 2 \langle \nabla_g \alpha_0, x \rangle \right)\\
    &= 2 F_0'(|x|_g^2,t) \left( \langle a, x \rangle_{g(0)} \cdot \alpha_0 + 2 x \cdot \nabla_x \alpha_0 \right)\\
    &= 2 F_0'(|x|_g^2,t) \left( \rho \cdot \alpha_0 + 2 \nabla_x \alpha_0 \cdot x \right).
\end{align*}
%
If we choose $\alpha_0$ such that $\alpha_0(0) = 1$, and $\rho \alpha_0 + 2 \nabla_x \alpha_0 \cdot x = 0$, then we therefore conclude that
%
\[ \Box_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 \} = \delta - (\Delta_g \alpha_0 + a \cdot \nabla_x \alpha_0) \cdot E_0 = \delta - c_0 E_0. \] 
%
Thus we have a fundamental solution with a remainder $c_0 E_0$. We deal with this additional term using the fact that $\Box_g \{ E_1 \} = E_0$. We choose a smooth function $\alpha_1$ so that
%
\[ \Box_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 + \alpha_1 E_1 \} = \delta - c_1 E_1, \]
%
and we consider this process, noting that, locally in time, the $\{ E_\nu \}$ become more and more regular as $\nu$ increases. We will be able to choose $\{ \alpha_\nu \}$ for all $\nu$ such that
%
\[ \Box_g \{ \alpha_0 E_0 + \alpha_1 E_1 + \dots + \alpha_n E_n \} = \delta - c_{n+1} E_{n+1}, \]
%
and thus we obtain an arbitrarily good approximation to a fundamental solution. One obtains a similar equation for $\Box_g \{ \alpha_\nu E_\nu \}$ to the one we calculated above for all $\nu$ (see Sogge, Chapter 2), and moreover, we have
%
\[ \alpha_0(x) = |g(x)|^{-1/4} |g(0)|^{1/4} \]
%
and for $\nu \geq 1$,
%
\[ \alpha_\nu(x) = \alpha_0(x) \int_0^1 t^{\nu-1} \frac{\Delta_g \alpha_{\nu-1}(tx)}{\alpha_0(tx)}\; dt. \]
%
By induction on $\nu$, all these equations are smooth.

Since all the quantities here depend smoothly on the metric $g$, and the metric smoothly varies as we vary the point $p_0$ we started with, we can perform this construction in a smoothly varying way for all points $p_0$ on the manifold $M$. If we let $x$ and $y$ vary over a compact set $K \subset M$, we thus obtain a function
%
\begin{align*}
    K_n(x,t;y) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^n \alpha_\nu(x,y) E_\nu( d_g(x,y), t ).
\end{align*}
%
which is well defined for $|t| \lesssim_K 1$. We then have
%
\[ \Box_g K_n(x,y,t) = \delta - (\Delta_g \alpha_{n+1}) E_{n+1}(d_g(x,y), t) = \delta - c_{n+1} E_{n+1}(d_g(x,y), t). \]
%
TODO: How do we get a solution operator from this parametrix. These operators should be FIOs of order $-1/4$, and for a fixed time, operators of order $0$. The remainder should be an FIO of order $-1/4-n-1$, and for a fixed time, of order $-n-1$.
%Thus this operator becomes more and more regular as $n \to \infty$. It follows that if we define the operators
%
%\[ S_n f(x,t) = \int K_n(x,y,t) f(y)\; dV(y), \]
%
%then for $0 < |t| \lesssim 1$,
%
%\[ \Box_g (S_n f)(x,t) = - \int c_{n+1} E_{n+1}(d_g(x,y), t) f(y)\; dV_g(y), \]
%
%and
%
%\[ \Box_g (S_n f)(x,0+) = f(x). \]
%
%Now it is important to note that the errors $\{ c_n E_n \}$ do not converge pointwise to zero as $n \to \infty$, and so we cannot take an infinite series here to get a complete solution operator. TODO: How to do we get a


But from the perspective of regularity, a finite expansion is normally enough. We can express $E_n(d_g(x,y),t)$ as a finite linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ t^j H(t) \int \frac{e^{2 \pi i (d_g(x,y) \cdot \xi + t |\xi|)}}{|\xi|^{\nu + k + 1}}\; d\xi. \]
% d = 2n
% N = n
% Symbol of order s = -nu - 1
% -nu-1 = m
In particular, this implies that for each $n$, $S_n$ is a Fourier integral operator of order $-5/4$, and if we fix the time, we get a Fourier integral operator of order $-1$.
%
\[ \frac{\sin(t |\xi|)}{|\xi|} \]

Assuming we have localized the support of $f$ to a compact set $K$ contained in a particular coordinate system $(y,V)$, and if $F(x,\xi)$ denotes the Fourier transform of $y \mapsto c_n(x,y) f(y) |g(y)|^{1/2}$, then
%
\begin{align*}
    \int c_n(x,y) E_n(d_g(x,y), t) f(y)\; dV_g(y)
\end{align*}
%
is a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ t^j H(t) \int \frac{F(x,\xi)}{|\xi|^{\nu + k + 1}} e^{2 \pi i (d_g(x,y) \cdot \xi + t |\xi|)}\; d\xi \]
%
Now we have
%
\[ \| F |\xi|^s \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{\dot{H}^s(\RR^d)} \]

Thus, modulo an operator that becomes more and more regular as $n \to \infty$, locally in $x$ and $t$, we have found operators which approximate solution operators to the wave equation.

\section{Explicit Hadamard Parametrix For The Sphere}

TODO

Consider geodesic normal coordinates for the sphere in $\RR^{d+1}_x$, centered at the south pole. Without loss of generality, to compute this metric we may assume our sphere is the locus given by the equation
%
\[ (y_0 - 1)^2 + y_1^2 + \dots + y_d^2 = 1 \]
%
and that the south pole is the origin. The metric in these coordinates is precisely the restriction of the metric $\sum dy_i^2$ on $T \RR^{d+1}$ to $S^d$. To work out the geodesic normal coordinates $x = (x_1,\dots,x_d)$ centered at the south pole. Then
%
\[ y_0 = 1 - \cos(r) \quad\text{and}\quad (y_1,\dots,y_d) = \sin(r) \cdot \frac{x}{|x|} \]
% 1 - cos^2(r)
% gamma(t) = ( t, (2t - t^2)^{1/2} )
% gamma'(t) = (1 , (1 - t) / (2t - t^2)^{1/2} )
% |gamma'(t)|^2 = 1 / (2t - t^2)
% int_0^T dt / sqrt(2t - t^2)
% int_{-1}^{T-1} du / sqrt(1 - u^2)
% u = sin(x)
% du = cos(x) dx
% int_{-pi/2}^{sin^{-1}(T-1)} dx
% pi/2 + sin^{-1}(T - 1)
% y_0 = 1 + sin(r - pi/2)
% y_0 = 1 - cos(r)

% Let u^2 = 2t - t^2
% When t = 1, u = 1
% Project from point (1,2)
% u = ax + (2 - a)

% int_0^a [- 2] da
% y^2 = 2x - x^2
% a^2x^2 = 2x - x^2
% (1 + a^2) x = 2
% x = 2/(1 + a^2)
% y = ax
% dx = -4a/(1 + a^2)
It will be simpler to work in polar coordinates $r$ and $\theta$, where $\theta$ is a unit vector in $\RR^d$. Then
%
\[ y_0 = 1 - \cos(r) \quad\text{and}\quad (y_1,\dots,y_d) = \sin(r) \theta. \]
%
Thus
%
\[ dy_0 = \sin(r)\; dr \]
%
and for $1 \leq i \leq d$,
%
\[ dy_i = \cos(r) \theta_i\; dr + \sin(r) d\theta_i. \]
%
%Now since $r^2 = \sum x_i^2$
%
%\[ dr = \sum (x_i/r) dx_i \]
%
%and $\theta_i = x_i / |x|$, so
%
%\[ d\theta_i = \frac{dx_i}{|x|} - \frac{x_i}{|x|^3} (x \cdot dx) \]
%
Thus $g^2 = dr^2 + \sin(r)^2 \sum_i (d\theta_i)^2$. The Laplace-Beltrami operator in these coordinates is thus
% |det(g)| = sin(r)^{d-1}
% 
\[ \Delta_g = \frac{1}{\sin(r)^{d-2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left\{ \sin(r)^{d-2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \right\} + \frac{1}{\sin r)^2} \Delta_\theta. \]
%
And we have
%
\[ |g| = \sin(r)^{2(d-1)} \]
%
Thus, using the terminology of Sogge, Chapter 2,
%
\[ a^r(x) = - \frac{(d-1)}{\sin(r)} \]
%
\[ \rho = - (d-1) \frac{r}{\sin(r)} \]
% TODO FINISH THIS CALCULATION


%
% If d = 1, alpha_0 = 1.
% If d = 2, alpha_0 = 1 / sin(x)^{1/2}
% alpha_0' = -cos(x)/2sin(x)^{3/2} = - cot(x) / 2 sin(x)^{1/2}

%
\[ \alpha_0(r) = \frac{c}{\sin(x)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \]
\[ - \frac{(d-1)}{2} \cot(r) \alpha_0 = \partial_r \alpha_0 \]

The highest order term in the Hadamard Parametrix for the Laplace-Beltrami operator is
%
\[ E_0(t,x) = E_+(t,r) \]
%


\[ g_{rr} = 1 \]
\[ g_{\theta_i \theta_i} = \sin(r)^2 \]
\[ g^{rr} = 1 \]
\[ g^{\theta_i \theta_i} = 1/\sin(r)^2 \]


%
%\begin{align*}
%    g^2 &= dr^2 + \sin(r)^2 \sum_i (d\theta_i)^2\\

%\end{align*}
%\[ g^2 = dr^2 + \sin(r)^2 \sum_i (d\theta_i)^2. \]

%
\[ g^2 = \Big( \cos^2(r) ( 4d (\sin(r) - 1)^2 + 1 ) \Big)\; dr^2 + \dots \]

\[ g^2 = \left( 2 \cos(r) \cos \left( \frac{r}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \right)^2\; dr^2 + \dots \]

it will help to work with polar normal coordinates $x = r \cdot \theta$, where $r > 0$ and $\theta \in S^{d-1}$. Then $y_0 = \sin(r)$ and $(y_1,\dots,y_d) = \sin(r) (2 - \sin(r)) \theta$

\chapter{Geometrical Optics}

Geometrical optics are useful not only in the classical analysis of light, but also as a first order approximation to the quantum behaviour of waves, and statistical optics (the study of randomness in waves -- \href{http://web.mit.edu/2.717/www/statopts.html}{This} website might be good to look into this in more detail).

%Let us briefly describe the historical process by which geometrical optics came to be. The main breadth of work had begun in the 17th century, with Descartes, Galileo, Snell, Fermat, Newton, and Huygens. But these philosophers were less interested in the behaviour of light, but instead with trying to understand the process by which a cause could have an instantaneous effect at a great distance (though R{\o}mer had demonstrated in 1676 that light travelled at a finite speed). In the 18th century, the focus instead focused on how light could unveal the processes of electricity, magnetism, and eventually, electromagnetism. Malus, Euler, and Lagrange discovered the theory of polarization, and Young and Fresnel on diffraction, birefringence. Debates ranged over whether light was corpuscular, or oscillated, as well as, if the oscillation occured, in which direction the oscillations occured (transverse, or longitudinal).









\chapter{Notes on Bochner-Riesz}

The goal of this section is to compare and contrast approaches to understanding the Bochner-Riesz conjecture on Euclidean space and on compact Riemannian manifolds, in order to reflect on the differences in understanding multipliers on $\RR^d$ vs on a compact manifold $X$ before we attack the more general multiplier problem in this setting. We define the Riesz multipliers via symbols $r_\rho^\delta: [0,\infty] \to [0,\infty)$, defined for $\rho > 0$ and a real number $\delta$ by setting, for $\tau > 0$,
%
\[ r_\rho^\delta(\tau) = (1 - \tau / \rho)_+^\delta. \]
%
Here $s_+ = \max(s,0)$. The resulting radial multipliers on $\RR^n$, and on a compact Riemannian manifold $X$, will be denoted by
%
\[ R_\rho^\delta = r_\rho^\delta \left( \sqrt{-\Delta}\ \right). \]
%
The goal of the Bochner-Riesz conjecture is to determine bounds on the operators $\{ R_\rho^\delta \}$ invariant under dilation of the symbol.

\section{Euclidean Case}

Let's review a reduction of Bochner-Riesz to Tomas Stein:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, we can \emph{rescale the problem}. If $r^\delta = r^\delta_1$, then
    %
    \[ r_\rho^\delta(\lambda) = r^\delta(\lambda / \rho). \]
    %
    Thus if $R^\delta = R^\delta_1$, then $R^\delta_\rho = R^\delta \circ \text{Dil}_{1/\rho}$, and so the operators $\{ R^\delta_\rho \}$ are uniformly bounded from $L^p$ to $L^p$ for all $\rho$ if and only if $R^\delta$ is bounded from $L^p$ to $L^p$.

    \item We now perform a \emph{spatial decomposition}. Let $k^\delta$ be the convolution kernel corresponding to the operator $R^\delta$. We break up the effects of the operator spatially into dyadic annuli, i.e. writing
    %
    \[ k^\delta(x) = \sum_{j = 0}^\infty k^\delta_j(2^j x), \]
    %
    where $k^\delta_0$ is supported on $|x| \leq 2$, and all of the other kernels $k^\delta_j$ are supported on the annuli $\{ 1/2 \leq |x| \leq 1 \}$, and can be written as
    %
    \[ k^\delta_j(x) = \phi \cdot \text{Dil}_{1/2^j} k^\delta \]
    %
    for some $\phi \in C_c^\infty$ supported on the annulus $\{ 1/2 \leq |x| \leq 2 \}$ and equal to one on the annulus $\{ 3/4 \leq |x| \leq 3/2 \}$. We analyze each of the convolution kernels separately and then collect up each of the bounds we obtain by applying the triangle inequality. Thus we let $R^\delta_j$ be the operator with convolution kernel $k^\delta_j$. Provided we can obtain a bound of the form
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_j f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim 2^{- \varepsilon j} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \]
    %
    for some $\varepsilon > 0$, and some implicit constant uniform in $j$, we can sum up the bounds using the triangle inequality to bound $R^\delta$.

    \item Spatial localization means that the operators $\{ R^\delta_j \}$ are \emph{local}, i.e. for any function $f$, the support of $R^\delta_j f$ is contained in a $O(1)$ neighborhood of the support of $f$. A decomposition argument, thus implies that it suffices to obtain a bound of the form
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_j f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim 2^{- \varepsilon j} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \]
    %
    for functions $f$ \emph{supported on balls of radius $1$}, since the general bound will follow from this.

    \item We \emph{reduce to $L^2$ bounds}: Now that $f$ is suported on a ball of radius 1, $R^\delta_j$ is supported on a ball of radius $O(1)$, and so for $p \leq 2$ we have
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_j f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| R^\delta_j f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}. \]
    %
    Thus it suffices to obtain a bound of the form $\| R^\delta_j f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$. Switching from the $L^p$ norm to the $L^2$ norm is the most inefficient part of the proof, but it enables us to apply more powerful tools which we only have in $L^2(\RR^d)$. Getting around this reduction is key to improving the currently known Bochner-Riesz bounds.

    \item We reduce the problem to Tomas-Stein. Since we are now in $L^2(\RR^d)$, we can apply Plancherel. If $\psi^\delta_j$ is the Fourier transform of $k^\delta_j$, then we obtain that
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_j f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} = \| \psi^\delta_j \cdot \widehat{f} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}. \]
    %
    A stationary phase calculation shows that $\psi^\delta_j$ has the majority of its mass on an annulus of radius $2^j$ and width $O(1)$, and has magnitude $O(2^{-j\delta})$ there, i.e.
    %
    \[ |\psi^\delta_j(\xi)| \lesssim_N 2^{-\delta j} \langle 2^j - |\xi| \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
    Thus by Tomas-Stein, if $R_S$ denotes the restriction operator to the unit sphere $S$, we find that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| \psi^\delta_j \cdot \widehat{f} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} &\lesssim_N 2^{-\delta j} \left( \int_0^\infty \langle 2^j |1 - r| \rangle^{-2N} \int_{|\xi| = 1} |\widehat{f}(r \xi)|^2\; d\sigma\; r^{d-1} dr \right)^{1/2}\\
        &\lesssim 2^{-\delta j} \left( \int_0^\infty \langle 2^j |1 - r| \rangle^{-2N} \| R_S \circ \text{Dil}_r f \|^2_{L^2(S^{n-1})} \frac{dr}{r} \right)^{1/2}\\
        &\lesssim  2^{-\delta j} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \left( \int_0^\infty \langle 2^j |1 - r| \rangle^{-2N}  r^{2d/p - 1} dr \right)^{1/2}\\
        &\lesssim 2^{-\delta j} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}.
        % f(x/r) -> r^d f^(rx)
        % 1/2^{j+1} <= |1 - r| <= 1/2^j
    \end{align*}
    %
    This bound is summable in $j$, which yields the required result.
\end{itemize}
%
Let us end our discussion of the Euclidean case by expanding on the computation of the inequality
%
\[ |\psi^\delta_j(\xi)| \lesssim_N 2^{-j \delta} \langle 2^j - |\xi| \rangle^{-N}. \]
%
Before this, let's see why the result is \emph{intuitive}. The function $\psi^\delta_j$ is obtained by localizing the frequency multiplier $m^\delta$ on the spatial side and then rescaling. Thus our result is intuitively saying that the phase-portrait of the multiplier is concentrated on a neighborhood of the set
%
\[ \{ (x,\xi) : |\xi| \leq 1\ \text{and}\ ||\xi| - 1| = 1/|x| \}. \]
% (1 - tau)^delta
% k_delta^j = Dil_{1/2^j} { k } phi
% 2^{-jd} [Dil_{2^j} m] * phi^
% m^delta = sum 2^{jd} Dil_{1/2^j} psi^delta_j
%
This makes sense, since the `high frequency' components of $m^\delta$ should be distributed near the boundary of the unit ball, since this is where the symbol becomes singular; that the spatial part should be inversely proportional to the distance to the boundary can be detected by taking derivatives of $m$ in the frequency variable, i.e. noting that if $||\xi| - 1| \sim 1/2^j$, then
%
\[ |\nabla^N m^\delta(\xi)| \lesssim_{N,\delta} (1 - |\xi|)^{\delta - N} \sim 2^{-j \delta} 2^{jN}. \]
%
And we see the derivative grows in $N$ as a power of $2^j$, which is inversely propoertional to $||\xi| - 1|$. Working more precisely, we have
%
\[ \psi^\delta_j = 2^{-jd} \left[ \widehat{\phi} * \text{Dil}_{2^j} m^\delta \right]. \]
%
The function is the average of $\widehat{\phi}$ over a ball of radius $O(2^j)$ so we immediately obtain a bound by using the rapid decay of $\widehat{\phi}$, thus obtaining that
%
\[ |\psi^\delta_j(\xi)| \lesssim_N \langle 2^j - |\xi| \rangle^{-N}. \]
% 
Thus we see that $\psi^\delta_j$ has the majority of it's support on the ball of radius $2^j$. But we can do much better than this using the fact that $\widehat{\phi}$ is \emph{oscillatory}, since $\phi$ is supported away from the origin, and $m^\delta$ is \emph{mostly} smooth. More precisely, $\widehat{\phi}$ oscillates at frequencies $\sim 1$, so we should expect integration by parts to yield useful decay on a quantity $\widehat{\phi} * \text{Dil}_{2^j} f$ if we had a bound $|\nabla^N f| \ll 2^{Nj}$ for large $N > 0$. This is true of $m^\delta$ away from a thickness $O(2^{-j})$ annulus containing the unit ball. Thus we are motivated to define $m^\delta = a^\delta_j + b^\delta_j$, where
%
\[ a^\delta_j(\xi) = m^\delta(\xi) \chi( 2^j (1 - |\xi|)) \quad\text{and}\quad b^\delta_j(\xi) = m^\delta_j(\xi) ( 1 - \chi( 2^j (1 - |\xi|)) ) \]
%
where $\chi(t)$ is supported on $|t| \leq 1$ and equal to one for $|t| \leq 1/2$. The function $b^\delta_j$ is therefore supported on $|\xi| \leq 1 - 1/2^{j+1}$. For $N > 0$, we have
% 
\[ |\nabla^N m^\delta_j(\xi)| \lesssim_{N,\delta} (1 - |\xi|)^{\delta-N}. \]
%
By the product rule, $\nabla^N b^\delta_j$ is a sum of derivatives of $m^\delta_j$ and of derivatives of $1 - \chi(2^j (|\xi| - 1))$. The support of any derivative of the latter is supported on $|\xi| \geq 1 - 1/2^j$. Thus we have
%
\[ |\nabla^N b^\delta_j(\xi)| \lesssim_N (1 - |\xi|)^{\delta - N} \mathbf{I}(|\xi| \leq 1 - 1/2^{j+1}) + 2^{j(N - \delta)} \mathbf{I}(1 - 1/2^j \leq |\xi| \leq 1). \]
%
Since $\phi$ is supported away from the origin, we may antidifferentiate $\widehat{\phi}$ arbitrarily many times without any singular behaviour emerging. But now averaging the $N$th antiderivative of $\widehat{\phi}$, which is rapidly decaying, with the $N$th derivative of $\text{Dil}_{2^j} b^\delta_j$, which is rapidly decaying outside of an annulus of width $1$ and radius $2^j$, we find that
%
\[ |(\widehat{\phi} * \text{Dil}_{2^j} b^\delta_j)(\xi)| \lesssim 2^{j(d - \delta)} \langle 2^j - \xi \rangle^{-N}. \]
%
The multiplier $a^\delta_j$ is not so smooth, but it is supported on a very thin annulus of radius 1 and thickness $O(2^{-j})$, and $m^\delta$ has magnitude at most $2^{- \delta j}$ on this annulus, which gives that
%
\[ |(\widehat{\phi} * \text{Dil}_{2^j} a^\delta_j)(\xi)| \lesssim 2^{-j\delta} \int_{||\eta| - 2^j| \leq 1} |\widehat{\phi}(\xi - \eta)|\; d\eta \lesssim_N 2^{j(d - \delta)} \langle 2^j - \xi \rangle^{-N}. \]
%
Putting these results together gives the required bound.

%$K_\rho^\delta$ is the kernel of $R_\rho^\delta$, then there exists symbols $a_1$ and $a_2$, of order zero, with $|a_1(x)|, |a_2(x)| \gtrsim 1$ for $|x| \gtrsim 1$, such that
%
%\[ K_\rho^\delta(x) = a_1(x) \frac{e^{2 \pi i |x|}}{\langle x \rangle^{\frac{n+1}{2} + \delta}} + a_2(x) \frac{e^{- 2 \pi i |x|}}{\langle x \rangle^{\frac{n+1}{2} + \delta}} + O \left( \frac{1}{\langle x \rangle^{n+1}} \right) \]

%    &= a_1(x) \frac{e^{2 \pi i |x|}}{\langle x \rangle^{\frac{n+1}{2} + \delta}} + a_2(x) \frac{e^{- 2 \pi i |x|}}{\langle x \rangle^{\frac{n+1}{2} + \delta}} + O \left( \frac{1}{\langle x \rangle^{n+1}} \right),
%\end{align*}
%
%where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are symbols of order zero, with $|a_1(x)|, |a_2(x)| \gtrsim 1$ for $|x| \gtrsim 1$. TODO: Necessity of the $\delta(p)$ values.

%
%\begin{align*}
%    K_\rho^\delta(x) &= \int_0^\rho (1 - \lambda / \rho)^\delta \left( \int_{|\xi| = \lambda} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi \right)\; d\lambda\\
%    &= \rho^{d-1} \int_0^1 \lambda^{d-1} (1 - \lambda)^\delta \left( \int_{|\xi| = 1} e^{2 \pi i \rho \lambda \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi \right)\; d\lambda\\
%    &= (2 \pi) \rho^{d/2} |x|^{1-d/2} \int_0^1 \lambda^{d/2} (1 - \lambda)^\delta J_{d/2-1}(2 \pi \rho \lambda |x|),
%\end{align*}
%
%where $J_{d/2-1}$ is a Bessel function of the first kind, i.e. defined by the integral formula

%\begin{align*}
%    J_\nu(s) &= \frac{1}{\pi^{1/2}} \frac{(s/2)^\nu}{\Gamma(\nu + 1/2)} \int_{-1}^1 e^{isx} (1 - x^2)^{\nu - 1/2}\; dx.
%\end{align*}
%
%We are interested with the asymptotic theory here: there exists constants $a_1(k)$ and $a_2(k)$ (See the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, 10.17: Hankel's Expansions for more detail) such that

%\begin{align*}

\section{Manifold Case}

The analogue of the Tomas Stein theorem on a compact Riemannian manifold $X$ is a result due to Sogge, so let's see if we can obtain a result for compact manifolds using similar techniques:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first problem is that on a compact Riemannian manifold we do not have a rescaling symmetry which we can use to reduce the study of the Bochner-Riesz multipliers $R^\delta_\rho$ to the case $\rho = 1$. Thus we must analyze a general multiplier of the form $R^\delta_\rho$ for all $\rho > 0$. The case of small $\rho$ is easily dealt with using the triangle inequality, so we may assume that $\rho \gtrsim 1$ in what follows.

    \item Now we try and reduce to Sogge's spectral cluster bounds, which are analogous to the Tomas-Stein bounds in $\RR^d$. If we are able to justify that $K^\delta_{\rho,j}$ behaves like a spectral band projection operator, as in the Euclidean setting, we'd be able to apply this bound. Plancherel does not quite have an analogy to the $L^2$ setting on a manifold. But we can instead use the wave operator and it's parametrices, i.e. that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        R^\delta_\rho &= \sum_\lambda r^\delta(\lambda / \rho) E_\lambda\\
        &= \rho \int_0^\infty \widehat{r^\delta}(\rho t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt\\
        &= c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty e^{2 \pi i \rho t} (t + i0)^{-\delta - 1} e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt.
    \end{align*}
    %
    The singularity in the definition of this integral occurs at $t = 0$, so the operator should, for large $t$, be relatively well behaved.

    \item Since we expect the function is well behaved for large $t$, let's bound these terms so we may reduce to controlling the integral over $t \lesssim 1$. Fix $\alpha \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ equal to one in a neighborhood of zero, and consider the behaviour of $R^\delta_\rho$ for large $t$, i.e. the operator
    %
    \[ R^\delta_\rho = c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty (1 - \alpha(t)) \cdot e^{- 2 \pi i \rho t} t^{-\delta - 1} e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt. \]
    %
    If $\psi$ is the inverse Fourier transform of $c_\delta t^{-\delta-1} (1 - \alpha(t))$, then $\psi$ is bounded and rapidly decreasing because all of the derivatives of it's Fourier transform are smooth and integrable. We thus can revert back to the multiplier setting and write
    %
    \[ R^\delta_\rho = \rho^{-\delta} \sum_\lambda \psi(\lambda - \rho) E_\lambda. \]
    %
    The rapid decay here means we can be fairly lazy in controlling this operator, for instance, employing the Sobolev embedding bound
    %
    \[ \| E_\lambda f \|_{L^2(X)} \lesssim \langle \lambda \rangle^{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2} \| f \|_{L^p(X)} \]
    %
    and the triangle inequality, using the rapid decay to obtain that
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_\rho f \|_{L^p(X)} \lesssim \langle \rho \rangle^{-[\delta - d(1/p - 1/2) + 1/2]} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}, \]
    %
    which is better than what we need. Thus we now need only bound the operator
    %
    \[ \tilde{R}^\delta_\rho = c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty \alpha(t) e^{2 \pi i \rho t} (t + i0)^{-\delta - 1} e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt. \]
    %
    The advantage of this localization is that Fourier integral operator methods tend to only give understand of the half-wave operator for times $|t| \lesssim 1$.

    \item We now `spatially localize' as in the Euclidean case, though things look different here since we are dealing with the wave equation. We choose $\beta$ such that
    %
    \[ 1 = \chi + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \text{Dil}_{2^j} \beta. \]
    %
    We then write
    %
    \[ R^\delta_{\rho} = \sum_{j = 0}^{O(\log \rho)} R^\delta_{\rho,j} \]
    %
    where for $j > 0$
    %
    \[ R^\delta_{\rho,j} = c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty \alpha(t) (\text{Dil}_{2^j} \beta)(\rho t) e^{- 2 \pi i \rho t} t^{-\delta - 1} e^{2 \pi i \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt, \]
    %
    and
    %
    \begin{align*}
        R^\delta_{\rho,0} &= c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty \alpha(t) \beta(\rho t) e^{-2 \pi i \rho t} t^{-\delta - 1} e^{2 \pi i \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt\\
        &= c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty \beta(\rho t) e^{-2 \pi i \rho t} t^{-\delta - 1} e^{2 \pi i \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt,
    \end{align*}
    %
    where the last identity follows because the result the support of the integral is on $t \lesssim 1/\rho$, and we are assuming $\rho$ is large so that $\alpha$ may be assumed equal to one on the support of the integral. Thus $R^\delta_\rho$ is an integral over times $|t| \sim 2^j / \rho$. This is analogous to the spatial decomposition we performed in the Euclidean setting, except now we have the wave equation involved, and the `pseudolocal' finite speed of propogation for the wave equation now must substitute for the explicit spatial localization we obtained in the Euclidean decomposition.

    \item Despite the singularity that occurs at the origin, the case $j = 0$ is simplest to deal with. If we define
    %
    \[ m(\lambda) = c_\delta (\widehat{\beta} * r_\delta) \]
    %
    then $R^\delta_{\rho,0}$ is a multiplier operator with symbol
    %
    \[ m_\rho(\lambda) = \rho^{-\delta} \text{Dil}_\rho m. \]
    %
    We have estimates of the form
    %
    \[ | \nabla^N m(\lambda) | \lesssim_N \langle \lambda \rangle^{-M}. \]
    %
    Thus
    %
    \[ | \nabla^N m_\rho(\lambda)| \lesssim_N \rho^{-\delta-N} \langle \lambda / \rho \rangle^{-M}. \]
    %
    In particular, taking $M = N$ and $M = 0$ yields that
    %
    \[ | \nabla^N m_\rho(\lambda)| \lesssim_N \rho^{-\delta} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
    Thus  $\{ \rho^\delta m_\rho \}$ are a uniformly bounded family of symbols of order zero. Thus we obtain that
    %
    \[ \| m_\rho(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f \|_{L^p(X)} \lesssim \rho^{-\delta} \| f \|_{L^p(X)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(X)}. \]
    %
    TODO: Check there isn't an error here since the $\rho^{-\delta}$ terms helps us out, but shouldn't our bounds be scale invariant?

    \item Now we deal with the $j > 0$ terms, and we must use the pseudolocal finite speed of propogation of the wave equation as a substitute for explicit localization. Since we have localized to times $t \lesssim 1$. We deal with this by using the Lax parametrix for the wave equation, but first we must ensure the remainder terms from employing the parametrix are well behaved. For $t \lesssim 1$, we can write $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} = Q(t) + R(t)$, where $Q(t)$ is a Fourier integral operator supported on a $O(1)$ neighborhood of the diagonal $\Delta = \{ (x,x): x \in X \}$, and with kernel given in coordinates by
    %
    \[ (x,y) \mapsto \int e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi|]} q(t,x,y,\xi)\; d\xi \]
    %
    where $q$ is a symbol of order zero, and $\phi$ is homogeneous of order one in $\xi$, with $\phi(x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi$, in the sense that
    %
    \[ |\nabla_\xi^N [ \phi(x,y,\xi) - (x - y) \cdot \xi ]| \lesssim_N |x - y|^2 |\xi|^{1-N} \]
    %
    for all $N > 0$. The operators $\{ R(t) \}$ are smoothing, i.e. with a joint kernel $A$ uniformly in $C^\infty([-1,1] \times X \times X)$. Thus we write
    %
    \begin{align*}
        R^\delta_{\rho,j} &= c_\delta \cdot \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty \alpha(t) (\text{Dil}_{2^j} \beta)(\rho t) e^{- 2 \pi i \rho t} t^{-\delta - 1} ( Q(t) + R(t) )\; dt\\
        &= R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q} + R^\delta_{\rho,j,R}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Let's control the $R(t)$ term. Computing the integral of the kernel defining $R^\delta_{\rho,j,R}$ leads to a term of the form
    %
    \[ c_\delta 2^j \rho^{-1-\delta} ( \widehat{\alpha A} * \text{Dil}_{\rho / 2^j} \widehat{\beta} * r^\delta)(\rho). \]
    %
    The function $\alpha A$ is smooth and compactly supported in the $t$ variable, so it's Fourier transform is rapidly decaying. The same is true of $\widehat{\beta}$, except it is rescaled so we can imagine the majority of it's mass occurs on $|\lambda| \lesssim \rho / 2^j$. Finally, $r^\delta$ is concentrated on $|\lambda| \lesssim 1$. Thus the kernel is pointwise bound from above by a constant times
    %
    \[ 2^j \rho^{-1-\delta} \int_{\rho - O(1)}^{\rho + O(1)} ( \widehat{\alpha A} * \text{Dil}_{\rho / 2^j} \widehat{\beta} )(\lambda)\; d\lambda. \]
    %
    Taking advantage of the oscillation of $\widehat{\beta}$, and the smoothness of $\widehat{\alpha A}$, i.e. integrating by parts, one can shows that for $|\lambda - \rho| \lesssim 1$
    %
    \[  |( \widehat{\alpha A} * \text{Dil}_{\rho / 2^j} \widehat{\beta} )(\lambda)| \lesssim_{N,M} (\rho / 2^j)^N \cdot \rho^{-M} \cdot (\rho / 2^j) = \rho^{1+N-M} 2^{-(N+1)j}, \]
    %
    Taking $N = M$ gives that the kernel is bounded above by
    %
    \[ 2^j \rho^{-1-\delta} \left( \rho 2^{-(N+1)j} \right) = 2^{-Nj}. \]
    %
    But now trivial estimates, e.g. using Schur's lemma implies that
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_{\rho,j,R} f \|_{L^p(X)} \lesssim_N \rho^{-\delta} 2^{-Nj} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}, \]
    %
    a bound that can be summed in $j$ by taking, e.g. $N = 1$. Thus we are now reduced to the study of the oscillatory integral operators $R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q}$.

    \item Now let's localize. First off, the condition that $K_{\rho,j}$ is supported on the diagonal, and the compactness of $X$, means we need only prove the result restricted to a single coordinate chart. Let $K_{\rho,j,t}$ be the kernel of the operator $R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q}$. Intuitively, the wave equation travels at unit speed, so, since $R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q}$ involves the wave equation localized to times $t \sim 2^j / \rho$, we should expect this kernel to be localized to $|x - y| \lesssim 2^j / \rho$. In fact, we will show that the restricted kernel
    %
    \[ K'_{\rho,j,t}(x,y) = K_{\rho,j,t}(x,y) \cdot \mathbf{I}(|x - y| \geq 2^{j(1 + \varepsilon)} / \rho) \]
    %
    has $L^\infty_y L^1_x$ and $L^\infty_x L^1_y$ bounds of the form $O_{\varepsilon,N}(2^{-jN})$, so that Schur's lemma implies that if we write $(R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q})'$ as the operator with kernel $K'_{\rho,j,t}$, then
    %
    \[ \| (R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q})' f \|_{L^p(X)} \lesssim_N 2^{-jN} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}. \]
    %
    This reduces us to proving localized estimates of the following form: for some $\varepsilon > 0$, and for any function $f$ supported on a ball of radius $2^j / \rho$, we have a bound
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q} f \|_{L^p( O(2^j / \rho) )} \lesssim 2^{-j \varepsilon} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}. \]
    %
    Notice the localization we get here is slightly weaker than in the Euclidean setting (the operators are localized to balls of radius $O(2^{j(1 + \varepsilon)} / \rho)$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$ rather than localized to balls of radius $O(2^j / \rho)$) which means our bounds here need the slightly greater decay in $j$ (the $O(2^{-j \varepsilon})$ bound above) rather than a bound independent of $j$.

    To prove the bounds for the restricted kernel $K'_{\rho,j,t}$ above, we just apply the principle of nonstationary phase to the integral representation, which says that for $|x - y| \gtrsim 2^{j(1+\varepsilon)} / \rho$ we have, taking the Fourier inversion formula in the $t$ variable,
    %
    \begin{align*}
        K'_{\rho,j,t} &= c_\delta \rho^{-\delta} \int_0^\infty \int \alpha(t) (\text{Dil}_{2^j} \beta)(\rho t) (t + i0)^{-\delta - 1} q(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi| - \rho t]}\; d\xi\; dt\\
        &= \int a^\delta_{\rho,j}(x,y,\xi,|\xi| - \rho) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi,
    \end{align*}
    %
    where
    %
    \[ a^\delta_{\rho,j}(x,y,\xi,\cdot) = c_\delta 2^j \rho^{-1-\delta} (\widehat{\alpha q(\cdot, x,y,\xi)} * \text{Dil}_{\rho / 2^j} \beta * r^\delta * q_{\cdot} (x,y,\xi)) \]
    %
    and therefore TODO satisfies estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |\nabla^n_t \nabla^m_\xi a^\delta_{\rho,j}| \lesssim_{n,m,N} 2^{-j \delta} (2^j / \rho)^n \langle 2^j \tau / \rho \rangle^{-N} \langle\xi \rangle^{-m} \]
    %
    Nonstationary phase TODO thus gives the required bounds.

    % Suppose the operator K1 = K I(|x - y| >= 2^{e j} ) has operator norm O_{N,e}( 2^{-Nj} ) for all N > 0
    % Given f, write f = sum f_Q, where f_Q is supported on a cube Q with sidelength 1
    % Then |f|_{Lp}^p = sum |f_Q|_{Lp}^p

    % We write Kf_Q = (K1)f_Q + (1 - K1)f_Q
    
    % Then (1 - K1)f_Q is supported on 2^{e j} * Q, which overlaps with at most O(2^{(e d) j}) other cubes. Thus
    % | (1 - K1) f |_{Lp}^p = | sum (1 - K1)f_Q |_{L^p}^p << 2^{ d e j (p/ p^*)} sum | (1 - K1) f_Q |_p^p
    % If we could show that | (1 - K1) f_Q |_p << 2^{-d e j / p^*}
    % then we would conclude that | (1 - K1) f |_{Lp} << sum |f_Q|_p^p = |f|_{Lp}^p
    
    % Often e is arbitrary, so we need only show any bound of the form | (1 - K1) f_Q |_p << 2^{- ej} to get the required result.

    \item It now suffices to show that for some $\varepsilon > 0$, and for any function $f$ supported on a ball $B$ of radius $2^j / \rho$, we have a bound
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q} f \|_{L^p( O(1) \cdot B )} \lesssim 2^{-j \varepsilon} \| f \|_{L^p(X)}. \]
    %
    Since we are localized, we can now, like in the Euclidean case, reduce to an $L^2$ bound, i.e. writing
    %
    \[ \| R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q} f \|_{L^p( O(1) \cdot B)} \lesssim (2^j / \rho)^{d(1/p - 1/2)} \| R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q} f \|_{L^2(O(1) \cdot B)}. \]
    %
    It now suffices to note TODO that $R^\delta_{\rho,j,Q}$ is a Fourier multiplier operator with symbol which is pointwise bouned by $O_N(2^{- j \delta}  \langle 2^j \tau / \rho \rangle^{-N})$, so we can now TODO apply Sogge's version of Tomas Stein on manifolds summed over geometric intervals to yield the required bounds.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Proof Involving Carleson-Sj\"{o}lin}

%On $\RR^d$, we can take Fourier transforms, applying stationary phase to determine that if $K_{\rho,\delta}$ is the convolution kernel corresponding to $R_\rho^\delta$, then
%
%\begin{align*}
%    K_\delta(x) &= \int_0^1 \lambda^{n-1} (1 - \lambda)^\delta e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\lambda\\
%    &= a_1(x) \frac{e^{2 \pi i |x|}}{\langle x \rangle^{\frac{n+1}{2} + \delta}} + a_2(x) \frac{e^{- 2 \pi i |x|}}{\langle x \rangle^{\frac{n+1}{2} + \delta}} + O \left( \frac{1}{\langle x \rangle^{n+1}} \right),
%\end{align*}
%
%where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are symbols of order zero, with $|a_1(x)|, |a_2(x)| \gtrsim 1$ for $|x| \gtrsim 1$. TODO: Necessity of the $\delta(p)$ values.

%\begin{lemma}
%    If $a \in C_c^\infty(\RR^n \times \RR^n)$, and $a(x,y) = 0$ unless $1/2 \leq |x - y| \leq 2$, then
    %
%    \[ \left\| \int e^{2 \pi i \rho |x - y|} a(x,y) f(y) \right\|_{L^q(\RR^n)} \lesssim \rho^{n/q} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^n)} \]
    %
%    if $q = [(n+1)/(n-1)] p^*$ and $1 \leq p \leq 2$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%    This is a non homogeneous oscillatory integral operator with wavefront set
    %
%    \[ \left\{ \left( x, y ; \frac{x}{|x - y|}, \frac{y}{|x - y|} \right) \right\} \]
    %
%    which, because of the assumption of the support of $a$, satisfies the Carleson Sj\"{o}lin conditions, and thus the result follows.
%\end{proof}

%The required bounds now follows by applying a dyadic spatial decomposition, rescaling, and applying the result above, hich can be applied because of our explicit computation of the kernel $K_\delta$ above.

\part{Review of Relevent Literature}

\chapter[HNS: Initial Radial-Multiplier Conjecture Bounds]{Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger: Initial Radial-Multiplier Conjecture Results} \label{HeoNazarovSeeger}

In this chapter we give a description of the techniques of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger's 2011 paper \emph{Radial Fourier Multipliers in High Dimensions} \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger}. One of the main goals of this paper is to verify the radial multiplier conjecture in $\RR^d$ for $d \geq 4$, and $1 < p < p_d$, where $p_d = 2(d-1)/(d+1)$, i.e. that if $m \in L^\infty(\RR^d)$ is a radial function, $d \geq 4$, and $\beta \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$ is nonzero, then
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \sim \sup_{t > 0} t^{d/p} \| T_m(\text{Dil}_t \beta) \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \quad \text{for}\ p \in \left(1, \frac{2(d-1)}{d+1} \right), \]
%
where the implicit constant depends on $p$ and $\beta$. We have
%
\[ \sup_{t > 0} t^{d/p} \| T_m(\text{Dil}_t \beta) \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \sim \sup_{t > 0} \frac{\| T_m(\text{Dil}_t \beta) \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}}{\| \text{Dil}_t \beta \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}}. \]
%
Thus we find that the boundedness of $T_m$ on $\mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$ is equivalent to it's boundedness on the family of inputs $\{ \text{Dil}_t \beta \}$. If we make the assumption that $m$ is compactly supported, then the assumption is equivalent to the fact that the convolution kernel $k$ associated with $m$ is in $L^p(\RR^n)$.

Another consequence of the techniques of this paper is that an `sharp' result for local smoothing. Namely, the techniques of the paper imply that if $d \geq 4$, and $q > 2 + 4/(d-3)$, then
%
\[ \frac{1}{2L} \int_{-L}^L \| e^{it \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^q\; dt \lesssim_{q,d} \| (I - L^2 \Delta)^{\alpha/2} f \|_{L^q(\RR^d)}^q, \]
%
where $\alpha = d(1/2 - 1/q) - 1/2$. This is an sharp result because $\alpha$ can be set \emph{equal} to the tight local smoothing exponent, rather than just arbitrarily close as in results that use decoupling type techniques.

\section{Discretized Reduction}

It is obvious that
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \gtrsim_\beta \sup_{t > 0} t^{d/p} \| T_m(\text{Dil}_t \beta) \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}, \]
%
so it suffices to show that
%
\[ \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_\beta \sup_{t > 0} t^{d/p} \| T_m(\text{Dil}_t \beta) \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}, \]
%
We will show this via a discrete convolution inequality, which can also be used to prove local smoothing results for the wave equation.

Let $\sigma_r$ be the surface measure for the sphere of radius $r$ centered at the origin in $\RR^d$. Also fix a nonzero, radial, compactly supported function $\psi \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$ whose Fourier transform is non-negative, and vanishes to high order at the origin. Given $x \in \RR^d$ and $r \geq 1$, define $\chi_{x r} = \text{Trans}_x (\sigma_r * \psi)$, which we view as a smooth function oscillation on a thickness $\approx 1$ annulus of radius $r$ centered at $x$. Our goal is to prove the following inequality.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma1}
    For any $a : \RR^d \times [1,\infty) \to \CC$, and $1 \leq p < p_d$,
    %
    \[ \left\| \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty a(x,r) \chi_{x, r}\; dx\; dr \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty |a(x,r)|^p r^{d-1} dr dx \right)^{1/p}. \]
    %
    The implicit constant here depends on $p$, $d$, and $\psi$.
\end{lemma}

How does Lemma \ref{lemma1} prove the required result? Suppose $m: \RR^d \to \CC$ is a radial multiplier, so we can consider it's convolution kernel $k: \RR^d \to \CC$, which is also radial, with $k(\cdot) = b(|\cdot|)$ for some function $b: [0,\infty) \to \CC$. If we set $a(x,r) = g(x) b(r)$ for any function $g: \RR^d \to \CC$, then the function
%
\[ F = \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty a(x,r) \chi_{x, r}\; dx\; dr, \]
%
is equal to $k * \psi * g$. In this setting, Lemma \ref{lemma1} says that
%
\[ \| k * \psi * g \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| k \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \| g \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
The left hand side is a Fourier multiplier operator applied to $g$, with symbol equal to $\widehat{\psi} \cdot m$, which is clearly related to the bounds we want to show. In particular, if $m$ is compactly supported away from the origin, let's say, on the annulus $1/2 \leq |\xi| \leq 2$. If we chose $\psi$ so that $\widehat{\psi}$ is nonvanishing on the annulus $1/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 2$, then the multiplier $1/\widehat{\psi}$ is smooth on the support of $m$, and so satisfies $L^p \to L^p$ bounds for all $1 < p < \infty$ restricted to functions with Fourier support on $m$. In particular, we conclude that $m$ is bounded from $L^p$ to $L^p$ if it's Fourier transform lies in $L^p(\RR^d)$. We can then use other tools (Hardy space technology and the like) to study more general multipliers that aren't compactly supported.

To prove Lemma \ref{lemma1}, it suffices to prove the following discretized estimate where we replace integrals with sums.

\begin{theorem} \label{lemma2}
    Fix a finite family of pairs $\mathcal{E} \subset \RR^d \times [1,\infty)$, which is \emph{discretized} in the sense that for any $(x_1,r_1)$ and $(x_2,r_2)$ in $\mathcal{E}$, one either has $x_1 = x_2$, or $|x_1 - x_2| \geq 1$, and one either has $r_1 = r_2$, or $|r_1 - r_2| \geq 1$. Then for any $a: \mathcal{E} \to \CC$ and $1 \leq p < 2(d - 1)/(d+1)$, 
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} a(x,r) \chi_{x, r} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} |a(x,r)|^p r^{d-1} \right)^{1/p}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant depends on $p$, $d$, and $\psi$, but most importantly, is independent of $\mathcal{E}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma1} from Lemma \ref{lemma2}]
    For any $a: \RR^d \times [1,\infty) \to \CC$, if we consider the vector-valued function $\mathbf{a}(x,r) = a(x,r) \chi_{x,r}$, then
    %
    \[ \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty \mathbf{a}(x,r)\; dr\; dx = \int_{[0,1)^d} \int_0^1 \sum\nolimits_{n \in \ZZ^d} \sum\nolimits_{m > 0} \text{Trans}_{n,m} \mathbf{a}(x,r)\; dr\; dx \]
    %
    The triangle inequality, and then the increasing property of norms on $[0,1)^d \times [0,1]$ implies that
    %
    \begin{align*}
    &\left\| \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty \mathbf{a}(x,r)\; dr\; dx \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}\\
    &\quad \leq \int_{[0,1)^d} \int_0^1 \left\| \sum\nolimits_{n \in \ZZ^d} \sum\nolimits_{m > 0} \text{Trans}_{n,m} \mathbf{a}(x,r) \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}\; dr\; dx\\
    &\quad \lesssim \int_{[0,1)^d} \int_0^1 \left( \sum\nolimits_{n \in \ZZ^d} \sum\nolimits_{m > 0} |a(x - n, r + m)|^p r^{d-1} \right)^{1/p}\; dr\; dx\\
    &\quad \leq \left( \int_{[0,1)^d} \int_0^1 \sum\nolimits_{n \in \ZZ^d} \sum\nolimits_{m > 0} |a(x - n, r + m)|^p r^{d-1}\; dr\; dx \right)^{1/p}\\
    &\quad = \left( \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty |a(x,r)|^p r^{d-1} dr dx \right)^{1/p}. \qedhere
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Lemma \ref{lemma2} is further reduced by considering it as a bound on the operator $a \mapsto \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} a(x,r) \chi_{x,r}$. In particular, applying real interpolation, it suffices for us to prove a restricted strong type bound. Given any discretized set $\mathcal{E}$, let $\mathcal{E}_k$ be the set of $(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}$ with $2^k \leq r < 2^{k+1}$. Then Lemma \ref{lemma2} is implied by the following Lemma.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma3}
    For any $1 \leq p < 2(d - 1)/(d+1)$ and $k \geq 1$,
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_p \left( \sum_{k \geq 1} 2^{k(d-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/p}. \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
    Note that if $2^k \leq r \leq 2^{k+1}$, then because $\| \chi_{x,r} \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \sim 2^{k(d-1)/p}$, we can write this as
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_p \left( \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \| \chi_{x,r} \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^p \right)^{1/p}. \]
    %
    Thus we are proving a kind of $l^p L^p$ decoupling for the functions $\chi_{x,r}$. This is strictly weaker than an $l^2 L^p$ decoupling bound. TODO: Could we possibly get an $l^2 L^p$ decoupling bound here?
\end{remark}

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma2} from Lemma \ref{lemma3}]
    Let
    %
    \[ F = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \]
    %
    and then for $k \geq 1$, let
    %
    \[ F_k = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{x,r}. \]
    %
    Then $F = \sum_k F_k$, and. Applying a dyadic interpolation result (Lemma 2.2 of that paper), the bound
    %
    \[ \| F_k \|_{L^r(\RR^d)} \lesssim 2^k (2^{k(d-r-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k)^{1/r}) \]
    %
    which holds for $r$ to the left and right of $p$, can be interpolated to yield that
    %
    \[ \| F \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum_k 2^{kp} ( 2^{k(d-r-1)} ) \right)^{1/p} \]


    Applying a dyadic interpolation result (Lemma 2.2 of the paper), Lemma \ref{lemma3} implies that
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\| \]

    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum 2^{kp} 2^{k(d-p-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/p} = \left( \sum 2^{k(d-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/p} \]
    %
    This is a restricted strong type bound for Lemma \ref{lemma2}, which we can then interpolate.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\section{Density Decomposition}

To control these sums, we apply a `density decomposition', somewhat analogous to a Calderon Zygmund decomposition, which will enable us to obtain $L^2$ bounds. We say a 1-separated set $\mathcal{E}$ in $\RR^d \times [R,2R)$ is of \emph{density type} $(u,R)$ if
%
\[ \#(B \cap \mathcal{E}) \leq u \cdot \diam(B) \]
%
for each ball $B$ in $\RR^{d+1}$ with diameter $\leq R$.

%A covering argument then shows that for any ball $B$,
%
%\[ \#(B \cap \mathcal{E}) \lesssim_d u \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{\diam(B)}{R} \right)^d \cdot \diam(B). \]
%
%(NOTE: WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO BETTER USING THE FACT THAT $\mathcal{E} \subset \RR^d \times [R,2R)$, USING THE VALUE $R$).

\begin{theorem} \label{DecompositionTheorem}
    For any 1-separated set $\mathcal{E}_k \subset \RR^d \times [2^k,2^{k+1})$, we can consider a disjoint union $\mathcal{E}_k = \bigcup_{m = 1}^\infty \mathcal{E}_k(2^m)$ with the following properties:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $m$, $\mathcal{E}_k(2^m)$ has density type $(2^m,2^k)$.

        \item If $B$ is a ball of radius $r \leq 2^k$ containing at least $2^m \cdot r$ points of $\mathcal{E}_k$, then
        %
        \[ B \cap \mathcal{E}_k \subset \bigcup_{m' \geq m} \mathcal{E}_k(2^{m'}). \]

        \item For each $m$, there are disjoint balls $\{ B_i \}$, with radii $\{ r_i \}$, each at most $2^k$, such that
        %
        \[ \sum_i r_i \leq \frac{\#(\mathcal{E}_k)}{2^m} \]
        %
        such that $\bigcup B_i^*$ covers $\bigcup_{m' \geq m} \mathcal{E}_k(2^{m'})$, where $B_i^*$ denotes the ball with the same center as $B_i$ but 5 times the radius.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Define a function $M: \mathcal{E}_k \to [0,\infty)$ by setting
    %
    \[ M(x,r) = \sup \left\{ \frac{\#(\mathcal{E}_k \cap B)}{\text{rad}(B)} : (x,r) \in B\ \text{and}\ \text{rad}(B) \leq 2^k \right\}. \]
    %
    We can establish a kind of weak $L^1$ estimate for $M$ using a Vitali type argument. Let
    %
    \[ \widehat{\mathcal{E}}_k(2^m) = \{ (x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k : M(x,r) \geq 2^m \}. \]
    %
    We can therefore cover $\widehat{\mathcal{E}}_k(2^m)$ by a family of balls $\{ B \}$ such that $\#(\mathcal{E}_k \cap B) \geq 2^m \text{rad}(B)$. The Vitali covering lemma allows us to find a disjoint subcollection of balls $B_1,\dots,B_N$ such that $B_1^* ,\dots, B_N^*$ covers $\widehat{\mathcal{E}}_k(2^m)$. We find that
    %
    \[ \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \geq \sum_i \#(B_i \cap \mathcal{E}_k) \geq 2^m \sum_i \text{rad}(B_i), \]
    %
    Setting $\mathcal{E}_k = \widehat{\mathcal{E}}_k(2^m) - \bigcup_{k' > k} \widehat{\mathcal{E}}_{k'}(2^m)$ thus gives the required result.
\end{proof}

To prove Lemma \ref{lemma3}, we perform a decomposition of $\mathcal{E}_k$ for each $k$, into the sets $\mathcal{E}_k(2^m)$, and then define $\mathcal{E}^m = \bigcup_{k \geq 1} \mathcal{E}_k^m$. For appropriate exponents, we will prove $L^p$ bounds on the functions
%
\[ F^m = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}^m} \chi_{x,r} \]
%
which are exponentially decaying in $m$, i.e. that
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim m \cdot 2^{-m(1/p - 1/p_d)} \left( \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
Thus summing in $m$ using the triangle inequality gives a bound on $F = \sum_m F^m$, in the range $1 < p < p_d$, i.e. that
%
\[ \| F \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/p}, \]
%
proving Lemma \ref{lemma3}. To get the bound on $F^m$, we interpolate between an $L^2$ bound for $F^m$, and an $L^0$ bound (i.e. a bound on the measure of the support of $F^m$). First, we calculate the support of $F^m$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma5}
    For each $k$,
    %
    \[ |\text{supp}(F^m_k)| \lesssim 2^{-m} 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
    %
    Thus we have
    %
    \[ |\text{supp}(F^m)| \leq \sum_k |\text{supp}(F^m_k)| \lesssim \sum_k 2^{-m} 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We recall that for each $k$ and $m$, we can find disjoint balls $B_1,\dots,B_N$ with radii $r_1,\dots,r_N \leq 2^k$ such that
    %
    \[ \sum_{i = 1}^N r_i \leq 2^{-m} \# \mathcal{E}_k, \]
    %
    where $\mathcal{E}_k(2^m)$ is covered by the expanded balls $B_1^* \cup \dots \cup B_N^*$. If we write
    %
    \[ F^m_{k,i} = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k(2^m) \cap B_i^*} \chi_{x,r}, \]
    %
    then $\text{supp}(F^m_k) \subset \bigcup_i \text{supp}(F^m_{k,i})$. For each $(x,r) \in B_i^* \cap \mathcal{E}_k(2^m)$, the support of $\chi_{x,r}$, an annulus of thickness $O(1)$ and radius $r$, is contained in an annulus of thickness $O(r_i)$ and radius $O(2^k)$ with the same centre as $B_i$. Thus we conclude that
    %
    \[ |\text{supp}(F^m_{k,i})| \lesssim r_i 2^{k(d-1)}, \]
    %
    and it follows that
    %
    \[ |\text{supp}(F^m_k)| \leq \sum_i r_i 2^{k(d-1)} \leq 2^{-m} 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

From interpolation, it therefore suffices to prove the following $L^2$ estimate on the function $F^m$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma6}
    Suppose $\mathcal{E} = \bigcup_k \mathcal{E}_k$ is a one-separated set, where $\mathcal{E}_k \subset \RR^d \times [2^k,2^{k+1})$ is a set of density type $(2^m, 2^k)$. Then
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim \sqrt{m} \cdot 2^{ \frac{m}{d-1} } \left( \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/2}. \]
\end{lemma}

% The L2 norms of the chi_{x,r} are equal to 2^{k(d-1)/2}, so the
% triangle ienquality implies that the LHS is bounded by sum_k 2^{k(d-1)/2} \#(E_k)

Note that this bound gets worse and worse as $m$ grows, whereas the support bound gets better and better, since annuli are concentrating in a small set, which is bad from the perspective of constructive interference, but absolutely fine from the perspective of a support bound. Interpolation gives a bound exponentially decaying in $m$ for $1 < p < p_d$.

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma3} from Lemma \ref{lemma6}]
    Write $F = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{x,r}$, and then perform a decomposition $\mathcal{E}_k = \bigcup_{m \geq 0} \mathcal{E}_k(2^m)$, and thus define $F = \sum_{m \geq 0} F_m$, where
    %
    \[ F_m = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}(2^m)} \chi_{x,r}. \]
    %
    We have
    %
    \[ \| F_m \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim 2^{\frac{m}{d-1} + \frac{k(d-1)}{2}} \log(2 + 2^m)^{1/2} \cdot \#(\mathcal{E}_k)^{1/2}. \]
    %
    If we interpolate this bound with the support bound for $F_m$, a kind of $L^0$ norm estimate, we conclude that for $0 < p \leq 2$,
    % ( int |F_m|^p )^{1/p} <= |S|^{1/pq^*} int |F_m|^{pq} )^{1/pq}
    % pq = 2
    % Then q = 2/p so 1/q^* = 1 - 1/q = 1 - p/2 = (2 - p)/2
    % so q^* = 2/(2-p)
    % 1/pq^* = (2-p)/2p = (1/p - 1/2)
    \begin{align*}
        \| F_m \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} &\leq |\text{Supp}(F_m)|^{1/p - 1/2} \| F_m \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}\\
        &\lesssim ( 2^{k(d-1) - m})^{1/p - 1/2} 2^{\frac{m}{d-1} + \frac{k(d-1)}{2}} \log(2 + 2^m)^{1/2} \cdot \#(\mathcal{E}_k)^{1/p} \\
        &\lesssim 2^{m(1/p_d - 1/p)} \log(2 + 2^m)^{1/2} 2^{\frac{k(d-1)}{p}} \#(\mathcal{E}_k)^{1/p}.
    \end{align*}
    % int |F_m|^p <= |S|^{1/p-1/2} ( int |F_m|^2 )^{1/2}
    %
    where $p_d = 2(d-1)/(d+1)$. This bound is summable in $m$ for $p < p_d$, which enables us to conclude that
    %
    \[ \| F \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim 2^{\frac{k(d-1)}{p}} \#(\mathcal{E}_k)^{1/p}. \]
    %
    Thus for $1 \leq p < p_d$, we obtain the bound stated in Lemma \ref{lemma3}.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\section{$L^2$ Bounds}

Proving \ref{lemma6} is where the weak-orthogonality bounds from Lemma \ref{lemma4} come into play. Indeed, we can write the inequality as
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim \sqrt{m} \cdot 2^{ \frac{m}{d-1} } \left( \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \| \chi_{x,r} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2}, \]
%
and if we had perfect orthogonality, or even almost orthogonality, then we could replace the $\sqrt{m} \cdot 2^{\frac{m}{d-1}}$ term with a constant.

To prove this $L^2$ bound, we require an analysis of the interference patterns of the functions $\chi_{x,r}$, which are supported on various annuli, but oscillate on these annuli. We will use almost orthogonality principles to understand these interference patterns which work the best now we have reduced our analysis to $L^2$ bounds.

%If $\psi$ is compactly supported, and $r$ is sufficiently large depending on the size of this support, then $\chi_{x,r}$ is supported on an annulus with centre $x$, radius $r$, and thickness $O(1)$. Thus $\| \chi_{x,r} \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \sim r^{(d-1)/p}$, which implies that
%
%\[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \gtrsim 2^{k(d-1)/p} \#(\mathcal{E}_k)^{1/p}. \]
%
%Thus this bound can only be true if $p \geq 1$, and becomes tight when $p = 1$, where we actually have
%
%\[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^1(\RR^d)} \sim 2^{k(d-1)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \]
%

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma4}
    For any $N > 0$, $x_1,x_2 \in \RR^d$ and $r_1,r_2 \geq 1$,
    %with $|x_1 - x_2| \geq 1$ or $x_1 = x_2$, and $r_1,r_2 > 1$,
    %
    \begin{align*}
        |\langle \chi_{x_1,r_1}, \chi_{x_2,r_2} \rangle| &\lesssim_N (r_1r_2)^{(d-1)/2} (1 + |r_1 - r_2| + |x_1 - x_2|)^{-(d-1)/2}\\
        &\quad\quad\quad\sum_{\pm,\pm} (1 + ||x_1 - x_2| \pm r_1 \pm r_2|)^{-N}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    In particular,
    %
    \[ |\langle \chi_{x_1,r_1}, \chi_{x_2,r_2} \rangle| \lesssim \left( \frac{r_1r_2}{|(x_1,r_1) - (x_2,r_2)|} \right)^{(d-1)/2} \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
    Suppose $r_1 \leq r_2$. Then Lemma \ref{lemma4} implies that $\chi_{x_1,r_1}$ and $\chi_{x_2,r_2}$ are roughly uncorrelated, except when $|x_1 - x_2|$ and $|r_1 - r_2|$ is small, and in addition, one of the following two properties hold:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $r_1 + r_2 \approx |x_1 - x_2|$, which holds when the two annuli are `approximately' externally tangent to one another.

        \item $r_2 - r_1 \approx |x_1 - x_2|$, which holds when the two annuli are `approximately' internally tangent to one another.
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger do not exploit the tangency information, though utilizing the tangencies seems important to improve the results they obtain. Laura Cladek's paper exploits this tangency information, to some extent, to obtain the improved result in her paper.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
%    We may assume $|x_1 - x_2| \geq 1$, for otherwise the inequality holds trivially since unless $|r_1 - r_2| \lesssim 1$, $f_{x_1r_1}$ and $f_{x_2r_2}$ have disjoint support, and if $|r_1 - r_2| \lesssim 1$ then Cauchy Schwartz implies that
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        |\langle f_{x_1r_1}, f_{x_2r_2} \rangle| &\lesssim (r_1 r_2)^{(d-1)/2}\\
%        &\lesssim_{N,d} (r_1r_2)^{(d-1)/2} (1 + |r_1 - r_2| + |x_1 - x_2|)^{-(d-1)/2} \sum_{\pm,\pm} (1 + ||x_1 - x_2| \pm r_1 \pm r_2|)^{-N}
%    \end{align*}
%
    We write
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \langle \chi_{x_1 r_1}, \chi_{x_2 r_2} \rangle &= \left\langle \widehat{\chi}_{x_1 r_1}, \widehat{\chi}_{x_2 r_2} \right\rangle\\
        &= \int_{\RR^d} \widehat{\sigma_{r_1} * \psi}(\xi) \cdot \overline{\widehat{\sigma_{r_2} * \psi}(\xi)} e^{2 \pi i (x_2 - x_1) \cdot \xi}\; d\xi\\
        &= (r_1 r_2)^{d-1} \int_{\RR^d} \widehat{\sigma}(r_1 \xi) \overline{\widehat{\sigma}(r_2 \xi)} |\widehat{\psi}(\xi)|^2 e^{2 \pi i (x_2 - x_1) \cdot \xi}\; d\xi.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Define functions $A$ and $B$ such that $B(|\xi|) = \widehat{\sigma}(\xi)$, and $A(|\xi|) = |\widehat{\psi}(\xi)|^2$. Then
    %
    \[ \langle \chi_{x_1, r_1}, \chi_{x_2, r_2} \rangle = C_d (r_1r_2)^{d-1} \int_0^\infty s^{d-1} A(s) B(r_1 s) B(r_2 s) B(|x_2 - x_1| s)\; ds. \]
    %
    Using well known asymptotics for the Fourier transform for the spherical measure, we have
    %
    \[ B(s) = s^{-(d-1)/2} \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} (c_{n,+} e^{2 \pi i s} + c_{n,-} e^{-2 \pi i s}) s^{-n} + O_N(s^{-N}). \]
    %
    But now substituting in, assuming $A(s)$ vanishes to order $100N$ at the origin, we conclude that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \langle \chi_{x_1 r_1}, \chi_{x_2 r_2} \rangle &= C_d \left( \frac{r_1r_2}{|x_1 - x_2|} \right)^{(d-1)/2} \sum_{n,\tau} c_{n,\tau}  r_1^{-n_1} r_2^{-n_2} |x_2 - x_1|^{-n_3}\\
        &\quad\quad\quad \Bigg\{ \int_0^\infty A(s) s^{-(d-1)/2}  s^{-n_1-n_2-n_3} e^{2 \pi i (\tau_1 r_1 + \tau_2 r_2 + \tau_3 |x_2 - x_1|) s}\; ds \Bigg\}\\
        &\lesssim_N \left( \frac{r_1r_2}{|x_1 - x_2|} \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{|x_1 - x_2|^N} \right) \sum_{\tau} \left( 1 + |\tau_1 r_1 + \tau_2 r_2 + \tau_3 |x_2 - x_1|| \right)^{-5N}\\
        &\lesssim_N \left( \frac{r_1r_2}{|x_1 - x_2|} \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{|x_1 - x_2|^N} \right) \sum_\tau \left( 1 + |\tau_1 \tau_3 r_1 + \tau_2 \tau_3 r_2 + |x_2 - x_1|| \right)^{-5N}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    This gives the result provided that $1 + |x_1 - x_2| \geq |r_1 - r_2| / 10$ and $|x_1 - x_2| \geq 1$. If $1 + |x_1 - x_2| \leq |r_1 - r_2| / 10$, then the supports of $\chi_{x_1,r_1}$ and $\chi_{x_2,r_2}$ are disjoint, so the inequality is trivial. On the other hand, if $|x_1 - x_2| \leq 1$, then the bound is trivial by the last sentence unless $|r_1 - r_2| \leq 10$, and in this case the inequality reduces to the simple inequality
    %
    \[ \langle \chi_{x_1,r_1}, \chi_{x_2,r_2} \rangle \lesssim_N (r_1 r_2)^{(d-1)/2}. \] 
    %
    But this follows immediately from the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.
\end{proof}

The exponent $(d-1)/2$ in Lemma \ref{lemma4} is too weak to apply almost orthogonality directly to obtain $L^2$ bounds on $\sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{xr}$ on it's own, but together with the density decomposition assumption we will be able to obtain Lemma \ref{lemma6}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma6}]
    Without loss of generality, we may assume that the $k$ such that $\mathcal{E}_k \neq \emptyset$ is $10$-separated. Write
    %
    \[ F = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \]
    %
    and $F_k = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{x,r}$. First, we deal with $F_{\lesssim m} = \sum_{k \leq 10 m} F_k$ trivially, i.e. writing
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| F \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} &\lesssim m^{1/2} \left( \sum_{k \leq 10m} \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 + \| \sum_{k > 10m} F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \right)^{1/2}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    We then decompose
    %
    \[ \| \sum_{k > 10 m} F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \leq \sum_{k > 10 m} \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 + 2 \sum_{k' > k > 10m} |\langle F_k, F_{k'} \rangle|. \]
    %
    Let us analyze $\langle F_k, F_{k'} \rangle$. The term will become a sum of the form $\langle \chi_{x,r}, \chi_{y,s} \rangle$, where $r \sim 2^k$ and $s \sim 2^{k'}$. Because of our assumption of being 10-separated, we have $r \leq s / 2^{10}$. If $\langle \chi_{x,r}, \chi_{y,s} \rangle \neq 0$, then since the support of $\chi_{y,s}$ is an annulus of radius $s$ centered at $y$, with thickness $O(1)$, and $\chi_{x,r}$ has support on an annulus of radius $r$ centered at $x$, with thickness $O(1)$, the fact that $r$ is comparatively smaller than $s$ implies that $(x,r)$ must be contained in the annulus of radius $s$ centered at $y$, with thickness $O(2^k)$. Such an annulus is covered by $O( 2^{(k'-k)(d-1)} )$ balls of radius $2^k$. Each ball can only contain $2^{k + m}$ points $(x,r)$, and so there can be at most
    %
    \[ O(2^{k'(d-1)} 2^{-k(d-1)} 2^{k+m} ) = O( 2^{k'(d-1) - k(d-2) + m} ). \]
    %
    pairs $(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k$ for which $\langle \chi_{x,r}, \chi_{y,s} \rangle \neq 0$. For such pairs we have
    %
    \[ |\langle \chi_{x,r}, \chi_{y,s} \rangle| \lesssim \left( \frac{2^k 2^{k'}}{2^{k'}} \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} = 2^{\frac{k(d-1)}{2}}. \]
    %
    Thus we conclude that
    %
    \[ |\langle F_k, \chi_{y,s} \rangle| \lesssim 2^{-k ( \frac{d-3}{2} ) + k'(d-1) + m }. \]
    %
    Summing over $10m < k < k'$, we conclude that since $d \geq 4$,
    %
    \[ \sum_{10m < k < k'} |\langle F_k, \chi_{y,s} \rangle| \lesssim 2^{k'(d-1) + m} \sum_{10m < k < k'} 2^{-k \frac{d-3}{2}} \lesssim 2^{k'(d-1) + m} 2^{-5m} \lesssim 2^{k'(d-1)}. \]
    %
    But this means that
    %
    \[ \sum_{10m < k < k'} |\langle F_k, F_{k'} \rangle| \lesssim 2^{k'(d-1)} \cdot \# ( \mathcal{E}_{k'} ). \]
    %
    This means that
    %
    \[ \| \sum_{k > 10m} F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \lesssim \sum_{k > 10m} \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 + \sum_{k'} 2^{k'(d-1)} \# (\mathcal{E}_{k'}), \]
    %
    and it now suffices to deal with estimates the $\| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}$, i.e. the interactions of functions supported on radii of comparable magnitude. To deal with these, we further decompose the radii, writing $[2^k,2^{k+1})$ as the disjoint union of intervals $I_{k,\mu} = [2^k + (\mu - 1) 2^{am}, 2^k + \mu 2^{am}]$, for some $a$ to be chosen later. These interval induces a decomposition $\mathcal{E}_k = \bigcup_\mu \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}$. Again, incurring a constant loss at most, we may assume that the $\mu$ such that $\mathcal{E}_{k,\mu} \neq \emptyset$ are $10$ separated. We write $F_k = \sum F_{k,\mu}$, and we have
    %
    \[ \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 = \sum_\mu \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 + \sum_{\mu < \mu'} |\langle F_{k,\mu}, F_{k,\mu'} \rangle|. \]
    %
    We now consider $\chi_{x,r}$ and $\chi_{y,s}$ with $r \in I_{k,\mu}$ and $s \in I_{k',\mu}$. Then we must have $|x - y| \lesssim 2^k$ and $2^{am} \leq |r - s| \lesssim 2^k$, and so we have
    %
    \begin{align*}
        |\sum_{\mu < \mu'} \langle F_{k,\mu}, \chi_{y,s} \rangle| &\lesssim 2^{k(d-1)} \sum_{\substack{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k\\ 2^{am} \leq |(x,r) - (y,s)| \lesssim 2^k}} |(x,r) - (y,s)|^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}\\
        &\lesssim 2^{k(d-1)} \sum_{am \leq l \leq k} 2^{-l(d-1)/2} \# \{ (x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k: |(x,r) - (y,s)| \sim 2^l \}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Using the density assumption,
    %
    \[ \# \{ (x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k: |(x,r) - (y,s)| \sim 2^l \} \lesssim 2^{l + m} \]
    %
    and so we obtain that, again using the assumption that $d \geq 4$,
    %
    \[ |\sum_{\mu < \mu'} \langle F_{k,\mu}, \chi_{y,s} \rangle| \lesssim 2^{k(d-1)} 2^{m(1-a(d-3)/2)}. \]
    %
    Now summing over all $(y,s)$, we obtain that
    %
    \[ |\sum_{\mu < \mu'} \langle F_{k,\mu}, F_{k,\mu'} \rangle| \lesssim 2^{k(d-1)} 2^{m(1 - a(d-3)/2)} \#(\mathcal{E}_{k,\mu'}). \]
    %
    and now summing over $\mu'$ gives that
    %
    \[ \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \lesssim \sum_\mu \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 + 2^{k(d-1)} 2^{m(1 - a(d-3)/2)} \# \mathcal{E}_k, \]
    %
    which is a good enough bound if we pick $a$ to be large enough. Now we are left to analyze $\| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}$, i.e. analyzing interactions between annuli which have radii differing from one another by at most $O(2^{am})$. Since the family of all possible radii are discrete, the set $\mathcal{R}_{k,\mu}$ of all possible radii has cardinality $O(2^{am})$. We do not really have any orthogonality to play with here, so we just apply Cauchy-Schwartz, writing $F_{k,\mu} = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}_{k,\mu}} F_{k,\mu,r}$, to write
    %
    \[ \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \lesssim 2^{am} \sum_r \| F_{k,\mu,r} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2. \]
    %
    Recall that $\chi_{x,r} = \text{Trans}_x(\sigma_r * \psi)$, where $\psi$ is a compactly supported function whose Fourier transform is non-negative and vanishes to high order at the origin. In particular, we now make the additional assumption that $\psi = \psi_{\circ} * \psi_{\circ}$ for some other compactly function $\psi_{\circ}$ whose Fourier transform is non-negative and vanishes to high order at the origin. Then we find that $F_{k,\mu,r}$ is equal to the convolution of the function
    %
    \[ A_r = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \text{Trans}_x \psi_{\circ} \]
    %
    with the function $\sigma_r * \psi_{\circ}$. Using the standard asymptotics for the Fourier transform of $\sigma_r$, i.e. that for $|\xi| \geq 1$,
    %
    \[ |\widehat{\sigma_r}(\xi)| \lesssim r^{d-1} (1 + r |\xi|)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}, \]
    %
    and since $|\widehat{\psi_\circ}(\xi)| \lesssim_N |\xi|^N$, we get that if $r \geq 1$, then for $|\xi| \leq 1/r$,
    %
    \[ |\widehat{\sigma_r}(\xi) \widehat{\psi_\circ}(\xi)| \lesssim_N r^{d-1-N} \]
    %
    and for $|\xi| \geq 1/r$,
    %
    \[ |\widehat{\sigma_r}(\xi) \widehat{\psi_\circ}(\xi)| \lesssim_N r^{\frac{d-1}{2}} |\xi|^{-N}. \]
    %
    Thus in particular,the $L^\infty$ norm of the Fourier transform of $\sigma_r * \psi_\circ$ is $O(r^{(d-1)/2})$. Now the functions $\psi_{\circ}$ are compactly supported, so since the set of $x$ such that $(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}$ is one-separated, we find that
    %
    \[ \| A_r \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim \# \{ x : (x,r) \in \mathcal{E} \}^{1/2}. \]
    %
    But this means that
    %
    \[ \| F_{k,\mu,r} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} = \| A_r * (\sigma_r * \psi_{\circ}) \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim r^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \# \{ x : (x,r) \in \mathcal{E} \}^{1/2}. \]
    %
    Thus we have that
    %
    \[ \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 = 2^{am} \cdot \# \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu} \cdot 2^{k(d-1)}. \]
    %
    Summing over $\mu$ gives that
    %
    \[ \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 = 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k (2^{am}  + 2^{m(1 - a(d-3)/2)}). \]
    %
    Picking $a = 2/(d-1)$ optimizes this bound, giving
    %
    \[ \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim 2^{m/(d-1)} 2^{k(d-1)/2} (\# \mathcal{E}_k)^{1/2}. \]
    %
    Plugging this into the estimates we got for $F$ gives the required bound.
\end{proof}

\section{Reformulating Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger Using Half-Wave Equations}

In variable coefficient settings, the method of breaking down an operator into it's behaviours on spheres, as was done in this argument, breaks down. Indeed, in the study of multipliers of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds, there is no analogue of the property that `the Fourier transform of a radial function is radial'. A more robust alternative is to use the \emph{half-wave operator}, i.e. writing
%
\[ h \big( \sqrt{-\Delta} \big) = \int \widehat{h}(t) W(t)\; dt, \]
%
where $W(t)$ is a smoothed out version of the wave propogator. In the Euclidean case, $W(t)$ is just the Fourier multiplier with symbol $\chi(\xi) e^{2 \pi i t |\xi|}$, for some smooth, compactly supported function $\chi$ supported on $|\xi| \sim 1$. In Section \ref{besselequivalencesection} of these notes, we showed that the condition used in \ref{HeoNazarovSeeger} is equivalent to the assumption that

\[ \left( \int \left( |\widehat{h}(t)| \langle t \rangle^{s_p} \right)^p \right)^{1/p} < \infty. \]
%
In this section, we try and reformulate the argument of Heo Nazarov and Seeger using the half-wave equation.

We begin with the discretization step. The desired inequality to use which replaces that of Lemma (TODO) is the inequality
%
\begin{align*}
    \left\| \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^\infty a(x,t) W(t,x,\cdot)\; dt\; dx \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \int |a(x,t)|^p \langle t \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)}\; dt\; dx \right)^{1/p}.
\end{align*}
%
The same trick allows us to discretize (TO ASK ANDREAS: DO THE SINGULARITIES MATTER), and then real interpolation shows it suffices to consider the bound
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{(x,t) \in \mathcal{E}} W(t,x,\cdot) \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \left( \#(\mathcal{E}_k) 2^{ks_p} \right)^p \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
To get $L^2$ orthogonality properties of the functions $\{ W(t,x,\cdot) \}$, we use Parseval's inequality to calculate that
%
\begin{align*}
    &\langle W(t,x,\cdot), W(t',x',\cdot) \rangle\\
    &\quad = \int \chi(\xi)^2 e^{2 \pi i[(t - t')|\xi| + (x - x') \cdot \xi]}\; d\xi\\
    &\quad = |x - x'|^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \int_0^\infty \rho^{d/2} \chi(\rho)^2 e^{2 \pi i (t - t') \rho} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(|x - x'| \rho)\; d\rho\\
    &\quad = |x - x'|^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \int_0^\infty \rho^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \chi(\rho)^2 a_{\pm}(|x - x'| \rho) e^{2 \pi i \rho [(t - t') \pm |x - x'|]}.
\end{align*}
%
Integrating by parts when the oscillatory integral isn't stationary, we obtain that for $|x - x'| \gtrsim 1$, that
%
\[ |\langle W(t,x,\cdot), W(t',x',\cdot) \rangle| \lesssim_N |x - x'|^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \big\langle |(t - t') \pm |x - x'| \big\rangle^{-N}. \]
%
Conversely, for $|x - x'| \lesssim 1$, but provided $|t - t'| \gtrsim 1$, we can simply integrate by parts in the formula
%
\[ \int \chi(\xi)^2 e^{2 \pi i [ (t - t') |\xi| + (x - x') \cdot \xi ]} \]
%
to get that
%
\[ |\langle W(t,x,\cdot), W(t',x',\cdot) \rangle| \lesssim_N |t - t'|^{-N}. \]
%
Finally, for $|x - x'| \lesssim 1$ and $|t - t'| \lesssim 1$,
%
\[ |\langle W(t,x,\cdot), W(t',x',\cdot) \rangle| \lesssim 1, \]
%
which can be calculated from the oscillatory integral equation, or just simply by Cauchy-Schwartz, i.e. because the $L^2$ norm of each term is $O(1)$, since this is the $L^2$ norm of $\chi(\cdot) e^{2 \pi i t |\cdot|}$.

We now use this, together with a density decomposition argument, to obtain bounds on the required quantities. TODO

\chapter{Cladek: Improvements Using Incidence Geometry} \label{Cladek}

The results of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger only apply when $d \geq 4$. Cladek found a method to get an initial radial multiplier conjecture result in $\RR^3$, and an improvmeent of the bounds obtained by Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger when $d = 3$. The idea is to exploit the fact that one need only prove a version of \ref{lemma2} for a set $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_X \times \mathcal{E}_R$, where $\mathcal{E}_X$ is a one-separated family of points, and $\mathcal{E}_R$ are a family of radii. One can then exploit this Cartesian product structure when analyzing functions of the form
%
\[ F = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r}, \]
%
in particular, improving upon the result of \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger}.

\section{Result in 3 Dimensions}

As in \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger}, Cladek first performs a density decomposition, i.e. writing
%
\[ F = \sum F_k^m \]
%
where
%
\[ F_k^m = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k(2^m)} \chi_{x,r}. \]
%
Cladek then interpolates between an $L^0$ bound and an $L^2$ bound on the resulting functions. The $L^0$ bound is exactly the same bound used in \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger}.

\begin{theorem}
    For the function $F$, we have
    %
    \[ |\text{supp}(F_k^m)| \lesssim 2^{-m} 4^k \# \mathcal{E}_k \]
    %
    and thus
    %
    \[ |\text{supp}(F^m)| \lesssim \sum_k 2^{-m} 4^k \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
\end{theorem}

The $L^2$ bound is improved upon, which is what allows us to obtain a new result in three dimensions.

\begin{lemma} \label{cladeksl2}
    Suppose $\mathcal{E} = \bigcup_k \mathcal{E}_k$ is a one-separated set, where $\mathcal{E}_k \subset \RR^d \times [2^k,2^{k+1})$ is a set of density type $(2^m, 2^k)$. Then
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \right\|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim_\varepsilon 2^{[(11/13) + \varepsilon] m} \sum_k 4^k \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
\end{lemma}

Interpolation thus yields that for a set of density type $2^m$ as in this Lemma,
%
\[ \| \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}} \chi_{x,r} \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_\varepsilon 2^{-m(1/p - 12/13 - \varepsilon)} ( \sum_k 4^k \# \mathcal{E}_k )^{1/p}. \]
%
If $1 < p < 13/12$, this sum is favorable in $m$, and may be summed without harm to prove the radial multiplier conjecture for unit scale radial multipliers in this range.

\begin{proof} [Proof of Lemma \ref{cladeksl2}]
    Write
    %
    \[ F_k = \sum_{(x,r) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \chi_{x,r}. \]
    %
    As before, we can throw away terms for $k \leq 10 m$, i.e. obtaining that
    %
    \[ \| \sum F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim m^{1/2} \left( \sum_k \| F_k \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 + \sum_{10m < k < k'} |\langle F_k, F_{k'} \rangle| \right)^{1/2}. \]
    %
    Our proof thus splits into two cases: where the radii are incomparable, and where the radii are comparable.

\chapter[MSS: Exploiting Periodicity]{Mockenhaupt, Seeger, and Sogge: Exploiting Periodicity}

The main goal of the paper \emph{Local Smoothing of Fourier Integral Operators and {C}arleson-{S}j\"{o}lin Estimates} is to prove local regularity theorems for a class of Fourier integral operators in $I^\mu(Z,Y;\mathcal{C})$, where $Y$ is a manifold of dimension $n \geq 2$, and $Z$ is a manifold of dimension $n+1$, which naturally arise from the study of wave equations. A consequence of this result will be a local smoothing result for solutions to the wave equation, i.e. that if $2 < p < \infty$, then there is $\delta$ depending on $p$ and $n$, such that if $T: Y \to Y \times \RR$ is the solution operator to the wave equation, and $Y$ is a compact manifold whose geodesics are periodic, then $T$ is continuous from from $L^p_c(Y)$ to $L^p_{\alpha,\text{loc}}(Y \times \RR)$ for $\alpha \leq -(n-1)|1/2 - 1/p| + \delta$. Such a result is called local smoothing, since if we define $Tf(t,x) = T_tf(x)$, then the operator $T_t$ is, for each $t$, a Fourier integral operator of order zero, with canonical relation
%
\[ \mathcal{C}_t = \{ (x,y;\xi,\xi) : x = y + t \widehat{\xi} \}, \]
%
where $\widehat{\xi} = \xi / |\xi|$ is the normalization of $\xi$. Standard results about the regularity of hyperbolic partial differential equations show that each of the operators $T_t$ is continuous from $L^p_c(Y)$ To $L^p_{\alpha,\text{loc}}(Y \times \RR)$ for $\alpha \leq -(n-1)|1/2 - 1/p|$, and that this bound is sharp. Thus $T$ is \emph{smoothing} in the $t$ variable, so that for any $f \in L^p$, the functions $T_t f$ `on average' gain a regularity of $\delta$ over the worst case regularity at each time. The local smoothing conjecture states that this result is true for any $\delta < 1/p$.

The class of Fourier integral operators studied are those satisfying the following condition: as is standard, the canonical relation $\mathcal{C}$ is a conic Lagrangian manifold of dimension $2n + 1$. The fact that $\mathcal{C}$ is Lagrangian implies $\mathcal{C}$ is locally parameterized by $(\nabla_\zeta H(\zeta, \eta), \nabla_\eta H(\zeta, \eta),\zeta,\eta)$, where $H$ is a smooth, real homogeneous function of order one. If we assume $\mathcal{C} \to T^* Y$ is a submersion, then $D_\xi [\nabla_\eta H(\zeta,\eta)]$ has full rank, which implies $D_\eta [\nabla \xi H(\zeta, \eta)] = (D_\xi [\nabla_\eta H(\zeta, \eta)])^t$ has full rank, and thus the projection $\mathcal{C} \to T^* Z$ is an immersion. We make the further assumption that the projection $\mathcal{C} \to Z$ is a submersion, from which it follows that for each $z$ in the image of this projection, the projection of points in $\mathcal{C}$ onto $T^*_z Z$ is a conic hypersurface $\Gamma_z$ of dimension $n$. The final assumption we make is that all principal curvatures of $\Gamma_z$ are non-vanishing.

\begin{remark}
    The projection properties of $\mathcal{C}$ imply that, in $T^* (Z \times Y)$, there exists a smooth phase $\phi$ defined on an open subset of $Z \times T^* Y$, homogeneous in $T^* Y$, such that locally we can write $\mathcal{C}$ as $(z, \nabla_z \phi(z,\eta), \nabla_\eta \phi(z,\eta), \eta)$ for $\eta \neq 0$. Then, working locally on conic sets,
    %
    \[ \Gamma_z = \{ (\nabla_z \phi(z,\eta)) \}, \]
    %
    and the curvature condition becomes that the Hessian $H_{\eta \eta} \langle \nabla_z \phi, \nu \rangle$ has constant rank $n-1$, where $\nu$ is the normal vector to $\Gamma_z$. This is a natural homogeneous analogue of the Carleson-Sj\"{o}lin condition for non-homogeneous oscillatory integral operators, i.e. the Carleson-Sj\"{o}lin condition is allowed to assume $H_{\eta \eta} \phi$ has rank $n$, which cannot be possible in our case, since $\phi$ is homogeneous here. An approach using the analytic interpolation method of Stein or the Strichartz / Fractional Integral approach generalizes the Carleson-Sj\"{o}lin theorem to show that for any smooth, non-homogeneous phase function $\Phi: \RR^{n+1} \times \RR^n \to \RR$, and any compactly supported smooth amplitude $a$ on $\RR^{n+1} \times \RR^n$. Consider the operators
    %
    \[ T_\lambda f(z) = \int a(z,y) e^{2 \pi i \lambda \Phi(z,y)} f(y)\; dy. \]
    %
    If the associated canonical relation $\mathcal{C}$, if $\mathcal{C}$ projects submersively onto $T^* \RR^n$, so that for each $z \in \RR^{n+1}$ in the image of the projection map $\mathcal{C}$, the set $S_z \subset \RR^{n+1}$ obtained from the inverse image of the projection of $\mathcal{C} \to Z$ at $z$ is a $n$ dimensional hypersurface with $k$ non-vanishing curvatures. Then for $1 \leq p \leq 2$,
    %
    \[ \| T_\lambda f \|_{L^q(\RR^{n+1})} \lesssim \lambda^{-(n+1)/q} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^n)}. \]
    %
    where $q = p^*(1 + 2/k)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    We can also see these assumptions as analogues in the framework of cinematic curvature, splitting the $z$ coordinates into `time-like' and 'space-like' parts. Working locally, because $\mathcal{C} \to T^* Y$ is a submersion, we can consider coordinates $z = (x,t)$ so that, with the phase $\phi$ introduced above, $D_x (\nabla_\eta \phi)$ has full rank $n$, and that $\partial_t \phi(x,t,\eta) \neq 0$. Then for each $z = (x,t)$, we can locally write $\partial_t \phi(x,t,\eta) = q(x,t,\nabla_x \phi(x,t,\eta))$, homogeneous in $\eta$, and then
    %
    \[ \mathcal{C} = \{ (x,t,y;\xi,\tau,\eta) : (x,\xi) = \chi_t(y,\eta), \tau = q(x,t,\xi) \}, \]
    %
    where $\chi_t$ is a canonical transformation. Our curvature conditions becomes that $H_{\xi \xi} q$ has full rank $n-1$. This is the cinematic curvature condition introduced by Sogge. %TODO: READ SOGGE, PROPOGATION OF SINGULARITIES AND MAXIMAL FUNCTIONS IN THE PLANE, WHICH INTRODUCES CINEMATIC CURVATURE?
\end{remark}

Under these assumptions, the paper proves that any Fourier integral operator $T$ in $I^{\mu - 1/4}(Z,Y;\mathcal{C})$ maps $L^2_c(Y)$ to $L^q_{\text{loc}}(Z)$ if
%
\[ 2 \left( \frac{n+1}{n-1} \right) \leq q < \infty \quad\text{and}\quad \mu \leq - n (1/2 - 1/q) + 1/q. \]
%
and maps $L^p_c(Y)$ to $L^p_{\text{loc}}(Z)$ if
%
\[ p > 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \mu \leq -(n-1)(1/2 - 1/p) + \delta(p,n). \]
%
If we introduce time and space variables locally as in the remark above, any operator in $I^{\mu - 1/4}(Z,Y;\mathcal{C})$ can be written locally as a finite sum of operators of the form
%
\[ Tf(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty T_t f(x), \]
%
where
%
\[ T_t f(x) = \int a(t,x,\eta) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,t,y,\eta)} f(y)\; dy\; d\eta. \]
%
is a Fourier integral operator whose canonical relation is a locally a canonical graph, then the general theory implies that each of the maps $T_t$ maps $L^2_c(Y)$ to $L^q_{\text{loc}}(X)$ if
%
\[ 2 \leq q \leq \infty \quad\text{and}\quad \mu \leq -n(1/2 - 1/q) \]
%
so that here we get local smoothing of order $1/q$, and also maps $L^p_c(Y)$ to $L^p_{\text{loc}}(X)$ if
%
\[ 1 < p < \infty \quad\text{and}\quad \mu \leq -(n-1)|1/p - 1/2| \]
%
so we get $\delta(p,n)$ smoothing. A consequence of the smoothing, via Sobolev embedding, is a maximal theorem result for the operator $T_t$, i.e. that for any finite interval $I$, the operator
%
\[ Mf = \sup_{t \in I} |T_t f| \]
%
maps $L^p_c(Y)$ to $L^p_{\text{loc}}(X)$ if $\mu < -(n-1)(1/2 - 1/p) - (1/p - \delta(p,n))$. If the local smoothing conjecture held, we would conclude that, except at the endpoint $T^*$ has the same $L^p_c(Y)$ to $L^p_{\text{loc}}(X)$ mapping properties as each of the operators $T_t$. We also get square function estimates, such that for any finite interval $I$, if we consider
%
\[ Sf(x) = \left( \int_I |T_t f(x)|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2}, \]
%
then for
%
\[ 2 \frac{n+1}{n-1} \leq q < \infty \quad\text{and}\quad \mu \leq -n(1/2 - 1/q) + 1/2, \]
%
the operator $S$ is bounded from $L^2_c(Y)$ to $L^q_{\text{loc}}(X)$.

Our main reason to focus on this paper is the results of the latter half of the paper applying these techniques to radial multipliers on compact manifolds with periodic geodesics. Thus we consider a compact Riemannian manifold $M$, such that the geodesic flow is periodic with minimal period $2 \pi \cdot \Pi$. We consider $m \in L^\infty(\RR)$, such that $\sup_{s > 0} \| \beta \cdot \text{Dil}_s m \|_{L^2_\alpha(\RR)} = A_\alpha$ is finite for some $\alpha > 1/2$ and some $\beta \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$. We define a `radial multiplier' operator
%
\[ Tf = \sum_\lambda m(\lambda) E_\lambda f \]
%
where $E_\lambda$ is the projection of $f$ onto the space of eigenfunctions for the operator $\sqrt{-\Delta}$ on $M$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$. We can also write this operator as $m(\sqrt{-\Delta})$. Then the wave propogation operator $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}$ is periodic of period $\Pi$. The Weyl formula tells us that the number of eigenvalues of $\sqrt{-\Delta}$ which are smaller than $\lambda$ is equal to $V(M) \cdot \lambda^n + O(\lambda^{n-1})$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $m \in L^2_\alpha(\RR)$ be supported on $(1,2)$, and assume $\alpha > 1/2$, then for $2 \leq p \leq 4$, $f \in L^p(M)$, and for any integer $k$,
    %
    \[ \left\| \sup_{2^k \leq \tau \leq 2^{k+1}} |\text{Dil}_\tau m(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f| \right\|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim_\alpha \| m \|_{L^2_\alpha(M)} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    To understand the radial multipliers we apply the Fourier transform, writing
    %
    \[ T_\tau f = (\text{Dil}_\tau m)(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f = m(\sqrt{-\Delta} / \tau) f = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tau \widehat{m}(t \tau) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt. \]
    %
    If we define $\beta \in C_c^\infty((1/2,8))$ such that $\beta(s) = 1$ for $1 \leq s \leq 4$, and set $L_k f = \text{Dil}_{2^k} \beta(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f$, then for $2^k \leq \tau \leq 2^{k+1}$
    %
    \[ T_\tau f = (\text{Dil}_\tau m)(\sqrt{-\Delta}) f = (\text{Dil}_\tau m \cdot \text{Dil}_{2^k} \beta)(\sqrt{-\Delta}) = T_\tau L_k f. \]
    %
    so Cauchy-Schwartz implies that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        |T_\tau f(x)| &= \left| \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tau \widehat{m}(\tau) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)\; dt \right|\\
        &\leq \| m \|_{L^2_\alpha(M)} \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\tau}{(1 + |t \tau|^2)^\alpha} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)|^2 \right)^{1/2}\\
        &\leq \| m \|_{L^2_\alpha(M)} \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{2^k}{(1 + |2^k t|^2)^\alpha} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)|^2 \right)^{1/2}
    \end{align*}
    %
    Because of periodicity, if we set $w_k(t) = 2^k / (1 + |2^k t|^2)^\alpha$, it suffices to prove that for $\alpha > 1/2$,
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int_0^\Pi w_k(t) |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim_{\alpha,p} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}. \]
    %
    This is a weighted combination of the wave propogators, roughly speaking, assigning weight $2^k$ for $t \lesssim 1/2^k$, and assigning weight $1/t$ to values $t \gtrsim 1/2^k$.

    For a fixed $0 < \delta$, we can split this using a partition of unity into a region where $t \gtrsim \delta$ and a region where $t \lesssim \delta$, where $\delta$ is independent of $k$. For each $t$, the wave propogation $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}$ is a Fourier integral operator of order zero (we have an explicit formula for small $t$, and the composition calculus for Fourier integral operators can then be used to give a representation of the propogation operators for all times $t$, such that the symbols of these operators are locally uniformly bounded in $S^0$). Thus the square function estimate above can be applied in the region where $t \gtrsim \delta$, because the weighted square integral above has weight $O_\delta(1)$ uniformly in $k$.

    Next, we move onto the region $t \lesssim 1/2^k$. The symbol of the operator $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}$

    Finally we move onto the region $1/2^k \lesssim t \lesssim \delta$. On this region we have $w_k(t) \sim 1/t$, which hints we should try using dyadic estimates. In particular, suppose that for $\gamma \leq \delta$, we have a family of dyadic estimates of the form
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int_\gamma^{2\gamma} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim \gamma^{1/2} (1 + \gamma 2^k)^\varepsilon \cdot \| f \|_{L^p(M)}. \]
    %
    Summing over the $O(k)$ dyadic numbers between $1/2^k$ and $\delta$ gives
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int_{1/2^k \lesssim t \lesssim \delta} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f|^2\; \frac{dt}{t} \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim 2^{\varepsilon k} \| f \|_{L^p(M)} \]






    If we were able to obtain this inequality for some $\varepsilon > 0$, then we could bound


     that for all $0 < \gamma < \Pi/2$


    If we localize near $t \lesssim 1/2^k$ by multiplying by $\phi(2^k t)$ for some compactly supported smooth $\phi$ supported on $|t| \lesssim 1$, then for $t$ on the support of $\phi(2^k t)$ we have a weight proportional to $2^k$, and rescaling shows that it suffices to bound the quantities
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int \phi(t) |e^{2 \pi i (t/2^k) \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2} \right\| \]

     the family of functions
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int |\phi(t) e^{2 \pi i (t / 2^k) \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)|^2\; Dt \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p_x} \lesssim \sup \| e^{2 \pi i (t / 2^k) \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f \|_{L^p_x} \]


    $a_k(t) = 2^{-k/2} \widehat{\phi}(t/2^k) \beta(\tau/2^k)$

    it suffices to uniformly bound quantities of the form
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int 2^k \phi(2^k t) |e^{2 \pi i \sqrt{-\Delta}} L_k f(x)|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim_{\alpha,p} \| f \|_{L^p(M)} \]
    %
    We now apply a dyadic decomposition to deal with the smaller values of $t$. Let us assume for simplicity of notation that $\delta < 1$, and then consider a partition of unity $1 = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \phi(2^j t)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$, and such that $\phi$ is localized near $1/4 \leq t \leq 2$, then our goal is to bound the quantities
    %
    \[ \left\| \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(2^j t) \frac{2^k}{(1 + |2^k t|^2)^\alpha} |A_t L_k f(x)|^2\; dt \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(M)}, \]
    %
    which are each proportional to
    \[ s \]

\chapter[LS: Decomposition Arguments for FIOs with Cinematic Curvature]{Lee and Seeger: Decomposition Arguments For FIOs with Cinematic Curvature}

Let's now discuss a paper \cite{LeeSeeger} entitled \emph{Lebesgue Space Estimates For a Class of Fourier Integral Operators Associated With Wave Propogation}. In this paper, Lee and Seeger prove a variable coefficient version of the result of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger, i.e. generalizing that result as it applies to sharp local smoothing on $\RR^d$ to the local smoothing of Fourier integral operators satisfying the cinematic curvature condition.

We consider a Fourier integral operator $T: \mathcal{D}(Y) \to \mathcal{D}^*(Z)$ of order $\mu - 1/4$, where $\dim(Y) = d$ and $\dim(Z) = d + 1$, with a canonical relation $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the following properties:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The projection map $\pi_R: \mathcal{C} \to T^* Y$ is a submersion. It follows that around any point $p = (z_0,y_0;\zeta_0,\eta_0)$ we can choose coordinate systems $y$ and $(x,t)$ on $Y$ and $Z$ respectively, centered at $z_0$ and $y_0$, such that $\zeta_0 = dx_1$, $\eta_0 = dy_1$, and the tangent plane to $\mathcal{C}$ at this point at $p$ is given by
    %
    \[ dx = dy \quad\text{and}\quad d\xi = d\eta \quad\text{and}\quad d\tau = 0. \]
    %
    In particular, it follows that $\pi_Z : \mathcal{C} \to Z$ is a submersion, and we can locally find a function $\phi(z,\eta)$, homogeneous in $\eta$, such that, locally,
    %
    \[ \mathcal{C} = \Big\{ (z, \nabla_z \phi(z,\eta)) \times ( \nabla_\eta \phi(z,\eta), \eta ) \in T^* Z \times T^* Y \Big\}. \]
    %
    By assumption on the tangent space of $\mathcal{C}$,
    %
    \[ (D_\eta \nabla_x) \phi(0, e_1) = I \quad (D_\eta \partial_t) \phi(0,e_1) = 0. \]
    %
    \[ \nabla_\eta \phi(0,e_1) = 0 \quad \nabla_x \phi(0,e_1) = e_1 \quad \partial_t \phi(0,e_1) = 0. \]
    %
    The equivalence of phase theorem implies we can find a symbol $a(x,t,y,\eta)$ of order $\mu$ such that, after appropriately microlocalizing the inputs and outputs of the operator $T$, we have
    %
    \[ Tf(x,t) = \int a(x,t,y,\eta) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,t,\eta) - y \cdot \eta]} f(y)\; d \eta\; dy. \]

    \item The last assumption implies that for each $z_0$, $\Sigma_{z_0} \pi_Z^{-1}(z_0)$ is a $d$ dimensional submanifold of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, our choice of coordinates makes it easy to see that the natural map $\Sigma_{z_0} \to T^*_{z_0} Z$ is an immersion, whose image is the immersed hypersurface $\Gamma_{z_0}$ of $T^*_{z_0}$. Indeed, the tangent plane to $\Sigma_{z_0}$ at the point above is given in coordinates by
    %
    \[ dx = dy = dt = d\tau = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad d\xi = d\eta. \]
    %
    And this is projected injectively to the plane defined by $d\tau = 0$ in $T^*_{z_0} Z$. Our other assumption we make about $\mathcal{C}$ is an assumption on \emph{cinematic curvature}. We assume that for each $z_0$, the hypersurface $\Sigma_{z_0}$ is a cone with $l$ nonvanishing principal curvatures, for some $1 \leq l \leq d-1$. Since
    %
    \[ \Sigma_{z_0} = \Big\{ (z_0; \nabla_z \phi(z_0,\eta_0) \Big\}. \]
    %
    Then the curvature assumptions amount to the fact that the Hessian matrix
    %
    \[ H_\eta \{ \partial_t \phi \} \]
    %
    has rank at least $l$ on a neighborhood on the support of $a$.
\end{itemize}
%
Given these assumptions, the following result is obtained.

\begin{theorem}
    If
    %
    \[ l \geq 3 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2l}{l-2} < q < \infty \quad\text{and}\quad \mu \leq \frac{d}{q} - \frac{d-1}{2} \]
    %
    then $T$ maps $L^q_c(Y)$ into $L^q_{\text{loc}}(Z)$.
\end{theorem}

If we take $l = d-1$, we get the full assumption of `cinematic curvature' and we can use this to get results about local smoothing of the wave equation on compact Riemannian manifolds, which recovers the local smoothing result of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger obtained in their paper on radial Fourier multipliers.

\begin{theorem}
    If $M^d$ is a compact Riemannian manifold,
    %
    \[ d \geq 4 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2(d-1)}{d - 3} < q < \infty, \]
    %
    and we set $\alpha = (d-1)/2 - d/q$, then
    %
    \[ \| e^{it \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^q_{t,\text{loc}} L^q_x(M)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^q_\alpha(M)}. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The solution operator for the half-wave equation is a Fourier integral operator of order $- 1/4$, where $\mu = 0$, associated with the canonical relation
    %
    \[ \mathcal{C} = \{ (x,t,y; \eta, \omega, \eta) : x = \exp_y(t \xi / |\xi|)\ \text{and}\ \omega = |\xi|_g \}. \]
    %
    It is immediate that the projection maps $\mathcal{C} \to T^* Y$ and $\mathcal{C} \to Z$ are submersions. For each $z_0 = (x_0,t_0)$,
    %
    \[ \Gamma_{z_0} = \{ (\xi, \omega) : \omega = |\xi|_g \} \]
    %
    is a spherical cone, and thus has $d-1$ nonvanishing principal curvatures. Consider the operator
    %
    \[ T = L \circ (I - \Delta)^{-\alpha/2}. \]
    %
    Then $T$ is a Fourier integral operator of order $-1/4 + \alpha$, associated with the same canonical relation $\mathcal{C}$. Applying the Theorem above, we conclude that for the $\alpha$ specified, $T$ maps $L^q(M)$ into $L^q_{t,\text{loc}}(\RR) L^q_x(M)$. But this implies that if $g = (I - \sqrt{\Delta})^{\alpha/2} f$, then
    %
    \[ \| e^{it \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^q_{t,\text{loc}} L^q_x(M)} = \| Tg \|_{L^q_{t,\text{loc}} L^q_x(M) } \lesssim \| g \|_{L^q(M)} = \| f \|_{L^q_\alpha(M)}. \qedhere \]
%An example situation of where the above results apply is to the Lax parametrix for the half-wave equation, which is a Fourier integral operator with $\mu = 0$. The phase $\phi$ above cannot be specified in elementary functions even in this practical examples, except in very special situations, like the half-wave equation on Euclidean space, in which case $\varphi(x,t,\eta) = x \cdot \eta - t |\eta|^2 / 2$, in which case $H_\eta \{ \partial_t \phi \}$ is the identity matrix, and thus has full rank everywhere.

\end{proof}

In Seeger, Sogge, and Stein, independent of the curvature in this problem, it is proved that
%
\[ \| T_R f \|_{L^\infty} \lesssim R^{ \frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{d}{q} } \| f \|_{L^\infty}. \]
%
By interpolating this bound, to obtain the result above, it is sufficient to obtain a restricted weak-type bound at the endpoint value of $q$.

\section{Frequency Localization and Discretization}

Let us describe the idea of the proof. Let $K(z,y)$ denote the kernel of $T$, i.e.
%
\[ K(z,y) = \int a(z,y,\eta) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(z,\eta) - y \cdot \eta]}\; d\eta. \]
%
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $a$ is supported on $|\eta| \geq 1$, since integrals over small frequencies give a smoothing operator. We localize in frequency, writing, working modulo smoothing operators by ignoring small frequencies,
%
\[ K(x,t,y) = \sum_{j \geq 100} 2^{j \mu} K_{2^j}(z,y), \]
%
where, for $R \geq 1$,
%
\begin{align*}
    K_R(z,y) &= R^{- \mu} \int a(z,y,\eta) \chi(\eta / R) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(z,\eta) - y \cdot \eta ]}\; d\eta\\
    &= \int a_R(z,y,\eta / R) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(z,\eta) - y \cdot \eta ]}\; d\eta
\end{align*}
%
where $a_R(z,y,\eta) = R^{-\mu} a(z,y,R \eta) \chi(\eta)$ is chosen to have uniform compact support, and such that
%
\[ |D^\alpha_{z,y,\eta} a_R(z,y,\eta)| \lesssim_\alpha 1 \]
%
holds uniformly in $R$. Let $T_R$ be the operator with kernel $K_R$.

\section{Discretizing the Problem}

It is more natural to establish estimates for the adjoint operator $T_R^*$. We will establish restricted estimates, i.e. bounding the behaviour of $T_R^* \{ \chi_E \}$ for a measurable set $E \subset \RR^{d+1}$. We have
%
\[ T_R^* \{ \chi_E \}(y) = \int \chi_E(x,t) \overline{a_R(z,y,\eta / R)} e^{2 \pi i [ y \cdot \eta - \phi(z,\eta) ]}\; d\eta\; dx\; dt. \]
%
The majority of the behaviour of $T_R^*$ depends on the behaviour of $\chi_E$ at frequencies with magnitude $\Theta(R)$, so we perform a discretization at a scale $1/R$. Taking a Fourier series in the $y$ variable, assuming $\text{supp}_y(a_R)$ is contained in $[-1/2,1/2]^d$, we write
%
\[ a_R(z,y,\eta) = \sum_{\nu \in \ZZ^d} a_{R,\nu}(z,\eta / R) \chi(y) e^{2 \pi i \nu \cdot y}, \]
%
where $\chi$ is some smooth, compactly supported function equal to one on $\text{supp}_y(K)$. We may then write
%
\[ T_R^* \{ \chi_E \}(y) = \sum_{\nu \in \ZZ^d} T_{R,\nu}^* \{ \chi_E \}(y) e^{2 \pi i \nu \cdot y}, \]
%
where $T_{R,\nu}$ is the operator with kernel 
%
\[ K_{R,\nu}(z,y) = \int a_{R,\nu}(z,\eta / R) \chi(y) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(z,\eta) - y \cdot \eta ]}\; d\eta. \]
%
The smoothness and support properties of the symbols $\{ a_R \}$ imply that
%
\[ |D^\alpha_{x,t,\eta} a_{R,\nu}(z,\eta)| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} |\nu|^{-N} \quad\text{for all $N > 0$}, \]
%
and so we can likely ignore the interactions between the operators $T_{R,\nu}^*$ as we vary $\nu$, i.e. by using the triangle inequality.

Let us now study the behaviour of the function $T_{R,\nu}^* \{ \chi_E \}$ on the set $\text{supp}_y(K)$. To do this, we discretize our operator at a scale $1/R$. Let $\mathcal{Z}_R$ be the set of points on the lattice $R^{-1} \ZZ^{d+1}$ which lies in some neighborhood of $\supp_z(K)$. For $\zeta \in \mathcal{Z}_R$, we let $Q_\zeta$ be the sidelength $R^{-1}$ cube centred at $\zeta$. Then $\{ Q_\zeta \}$ is an almost disjoint family of cubes covering $\supp_z(K)$. Define
%
\[ a_{R,\nu,\zeta}(\eta) = \int_{Q_\zeta \cap E} a_{R,\nu}(z,\eta / R) \chi(y) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(\zeta,\eta) - \phi(z,\eta) ]}\; dz. \]
%
Then if we define
%
\begin{align*}
    S_{R,\nu,\zeta}(y) &= \int a_{R,\nu,\zeta}(\eta) e^{2 \pi i [ y \cdot \eta - \phi(\zeta,\eta) ]}\; d\eta,
\end{align*}
%
then for $y \in \text{supp}_y(K)$,
%
\[ T_{R,\nu}^* \{ \chi_E \}(y) = \sum_\zeta S_{R,\nu,\zeta}(y). \]
%
Now for $z \in Q_\zeta$ and $|\eta| \sim R$,
%
\[ |\partial_\eta^\alpha \{ \phi(\zeta, \eta) - \phi(z,\eta) \}| \lesssim_\alpha R^{-\alpha} \quad\text{for all $\alpha$}, \]
%
which allows us to conclude that
%
\[ |D^\alpha_\eta a_{R,\nu,\zeta}(\eta)| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} |Q_\zeta \cap E| \cdot R^{-\alpha} \langle \nu \rangle^{-N} \quad\text{for all $\alpha$ and $\nu > 0$}. \]
%
We are thus reduced to the analysis of the quantities
%
\[ \sum_{\zeta \in \mathcal{Z}_R} S_{R,\nu,\zeta}. \]
%
If, for $m \geq 0$, we write
%
\[ Z_{R,m} = \{ \zeta: |Q_\zeta \cap E| \sim 2^{-m} (1/R)^{d+1} \}, \]
%
then in the next section, we will obtain estimates of the form
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{\zeta \in Z_{R,m}} S_{R,\nu,\zeta} \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}} \lesssim_N \langle \nu \rangle^{-N} [2^{-m} (1/R)^{d+1}] \cdot R^{ \frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{1}{p} } \#(Z_{R,m})^{1/p}. \]
%
If we set $E_{R,m} = \bigcup_{\zeta \in Z_{R,m}} Q_\zeta \cap E$, then $E = \bigcup_m E_{R,m}$. For each $m$,
%
\[ \#(Z_{R,m}) \sim 2^m R^{d+1} |E_{R,m}|, \]
%
and so the estimate above implies that
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{\zeta \in Z_{R,m}} S_{R,\nu,\zeta} \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}} \lesssim_N \langle \nu \rangle^{-N} 2^{-m / q} R^{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2} |E_{R,m}|^{1/p}. \]
%
Summing in $m \geq 0$, and using H\"{o}lder's inequality to prove that for any non-negative numbers $\{ a_m \}$, we have
%
\[ \sum_m 2^{-m/q} a_m^{1/p} \lesssim_q ( \sum a_m )^{1/p}, \]
%
we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| T_{R,\nu}^* \{ \chi_E \} \|_{L^{p,\infty}} &= \left\| \sum_{\zeta \in \mathcal{Z}_R} S_{R,\nu,\zeta} \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}}\\
    &\lesssim \sum_m \left\| \sum_{\zeta \in Z_{R,m}} S_{R,\nu,\zeta} \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}}\\
    &\lesssim_N \langle \nu \rangle^{-N} R^{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2} |E|^{1/p}.
\end{align*}
%
Summing over $\nu$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| T_R^* \{ \chi_E \} \|_{L^{p,\infty}} \lesssim R^{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2} |E|^{1/p}. \]
%
Thus we have proved a restricted weak-type bound for the operators $T_R^*$.

\section{Interactions of Discretized Operators}

Our proof now rests on the following problem. We fix a large constant $M > 0$, to be specified later. Our goal is to prove the following Lemma.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemmaDiscreteBound}
    For each $Z \subset \mathcal{Z}_R$, and each $C > 0$, suppose there exists a symbol $a_\zeta(\eta)$ supported on $|\eta| \sim R$, and satisfying derivative bounds of the form
    %
    \[ |(\partial_\xi^\alpha a_\zeta)(\eta)| \leq C R^{-\alpha} \quad\text{for $|\alpha| \leq M$}. \]
    %
    If we define
    %
    \[ S_\zeta(y) = \int a_\zeta(\eta) e^{2 \pi i [y \cdot \eta - \phi(\zeta, \eta)]}\; d\eta, \]
    %
    then
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_{\zeta \in Z} S_\zeta \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}} \lesssim C R^{ \frac{d+1}{2} - \frac{1}{p} } \#(Z)^{1/p}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is independent of $C$, $R$, and $Z$.
\end{lemma}

Lemma \ref{lemmaDiscreteBound} is clearly sufficient to prove the estimate mentioned in the last section. So let's now prove it. By linearity, we may assume without loss of generality that $C = 1$.

We will obtain the Lemma by interpolating a combination of more elementary estimates, namely, a pair of $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ bounds for the sum, which do not take advantage of the curvature in the problem, and an $L^2$ bound which does take into account this curvature.

% If $\{ P_R \}$ is a family of Littlewood-Paley projections on $\RR^{d+1}$ induced by a function equal to one on a suitably thick region of the unit annulus, then the principle of nonstationary phase implies that the operator $G = K_R^* \circ (I - P_R)$ is a smoothing operator, with derivative estimates
%
%\[ |(\nabla^M_{y,z} G)(y,z)| \lesssim_{N,M} R^{-N} \]
%
%for all $N,M \geq 0$. Thus we may restrict our analysis to $K_R^* \circ P_R$, i.e. we may study $K_R^*$ from the perspective that all inputs are Fourier localized to frequencies with magnitude $\Theta(R)$. The uncertainty principle thus leads us to imagine that these inputs are locally constant at a scale $1/R$, which motivates us to believe that we can write
%
%\[ K_R^* f \approx \sum_{\zeta \in Z_R} c_\zeta S_\zeta, \]
%
%where $Z_R$ is a $1/R$ discretized subset of some small ball about the origin in $\RR^{d+1}$, and for each $\zeta \in Z_R$,
%
%\[ S_\zeta(y) = \int a_\zeta(\eta) e^{2 \pi i R (y \cdot \eta - \varphi(\zeta,\eta))}\; d\eta, \]
%
%for some smooth, compactly supported functions $\{ a_\zeta : \zeta \in Z_R \}$ with uniform bounds on their derivatives. We are thus motivated to consider the behaviour of the functions $\{ S_\zeta \}$ and their interactions.

To understand the individual behaviour of the functions $\{ S_\zeta \}$, we perform a `double dyadic decomposition', i.e. taking a $R^{-1/2}$ discretized subset $\Theta_R$ of unit vectors in $\RR^d$, consider some smooth partition of unity adapted to the $O(1/R^{1/2})$ neighborhoods of these unit vectors, and thus consider the associated decomposition $a_\zeta = \sum_\theta a_{\zeta,\theta}$. Applyig non-stationary phase, we get that, for the resulting decomposition $S_\zeta = \sum_\theta S_{\zeta,\theta}$, the function $S_{\zeta,\theta}$ has the majority of it's support on a cap about the point $\nabla_\xi \varphi(\zeta,\theta)$, with thickness $R^{-1}$ in the $\theta$-direction, and thickness $R^{-1/2}$ in the directions orthogonal to $\theta$. Moreover, on this cap, $S_{\zeta,\theta}$ has magnitude $O(R^{(d+1)/2})$. Completely ignoring the interactions between these caps, which do not matter anyhow given we are taking the $L^1$ norm of the functions, the triangle inequality implies that
%
\[ \| S_\zeta \|_{L^1} \leq \sum_\theta \| S_{\zeta,\theta} \|_{L^1} \lesssim R^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \cdot R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \cdot R^{-1} R^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} = R^{\frac{d-1}{2}}.  \]
%
We interpolate this bound with some $L^2$ orthogonality bounds for the family $\{ S_\zeta \}$ to prove the required result.

We will use Fourier analysis to obtain these $L^2$ bounds, which is more simple given that the symbols we now have in our Fourier integral operators are independent of $y$. Namely, we have
%
\[ \widehat{S}_\zeta(\eta) = a_\zeta(\eta) e^{- 2 \pi i \phi(\zeta,\eta)}. \]
%
Fix $\zeta = (x,t)$ and $\zeta' = (x',t')$. By the multiplication formula,
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle S_\zeta, S_{\zeta'} \rangle &= \langle \widehat{S}_\zeta, \widehat{S}_{\zeta'} \rangle\\
    &= \int a_\zeta(\eta) a_{\zeta'}(\eta) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(\zeta', \eta) - \phi(\zeta,\eta) ]}\; d\eta\\
    &= R^d \int a_\zeta( R \eta) a_{\zeta'}( R \eta ) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(\zeta', \eta) - \phi(\zeta, \eta) ] }.
\end{align*}
%
Let us write $\phi_{\zeta,\zeta'}(\eta)$ for the phase in this oscillatory integral. Then
%
\[ \nabla_\eta \phi_{\zeta,\zeta'}(\eta) = \nabla_\eta \phi(\zeta', \eta) - \nabla_\eta \phi(\zeta, \eta). \]
%
Provided we have localized our analysis to a suitably small neighborhood of $(0,e_1)$, our assumptions that
%
\[ (D_\eta \nabla_x \phi)(0, e_1) = I \quad\text{and}\quad (D_\eta \partial_t \phi)(0,e_1) = 0 \]
%
imply that
%
\[ |\nabla_\eta \phi_{\zeta,\zeta'}(\eta)| \geq 0.5 |x - x'| - 0.1 |t - t'|. \]
%
Thus we conclude using this formula that if $|x - x'| \geq 0.5 |t - t'|$, then we have a non-stationary phase, and we can integrate by parts to conclude that for all $N \leq M$,
%
\[ \langle S_\zeta, S_{\zeta'} \rangle \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \]
%
On the other hand, suppose that $|x - x'| \leq 0.5 |t - t'|$. Set $\zeta(s) = \zeta + s(\zeta' - \zeta)$, and write
%
\[ \frac{\phi(\zeta',\eta) - \phi(\zeta, \eta)}{t' - t} = \int_0^1 \left[ \partial_t \phi(\zeta_s, \eta) + \left( \frac{x' - x}{t' - t} \right) \cdot \nabla_x \phi(\zeta_s, \eta) \right]\; ds. \]
%
It follows that the left hand side is a pertubation of $\partial_t \phi(0, \eta)$. The phase
%
\[ (t,t') \mapsto (t' - t) \cdot \partial_t \phi(0,\eta) \]
%
has a stationary point at $(0,e_1)$ by assumption that $(D_\eta \partial_t) \phi(0,e_1) = 0$. But the Hessian $H_\eta(\partial_t \phi)$ has rank $l$ at $(0,e_1)$, so the principle of stationary phase `with parameters' (to account for the pertubation in phase, see H\"{o}rmander's FIO I paper for details) implies that
%
\[ \langle S_\zeta, S_{\zeta'} \rangle \lesssim R^d \langle R |t - t'| \rangle^{-l/2} \quad\text{if}\ |x - x'| \leq 0.5 |t - t'|. \]
%
Putting this bound together with the previous bound, we conclude that for any two $\zeta$ and $\zeta'$, we have
%
\[ \langle S_\zeta, S_{\zeta'} \rangle \lesssim \frac{R^d}{\langle R |\zeta - \zeta'| \rangle^{l/2}}. \]
%
Together with a form of the Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund decomposition introduced by Heo, Nasarov and Seeger, this bound will be sufficient to prove we get the bound required. TODO.











\chapter[BHS: Decoupling for FIOs]{Beltran, Hickman, and Sogge: Decoupling for Fourier Integral Operators}

The paper we now discuss extends the theory of decoupling, which was originally used to establish local smoothing for the wave equation on Euclidean space, to the setting of more general FIOs. Here we attempt to study $L^p$ to $L^p$ estimates  for Fourier integral operators given by
%
\[ Tf(x,t) = \int_{\RR^d} e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,t;\xi)} b(x,t;\xi) (1 + |\xi|^2)^{\mu/2} \widehat{f}(\xi)\; d\xi \]
%
where $b$ is a compactly supported symbol of order zero, compactly supported in $x$ and $t$, and $\phi$ is a phase function, homogeneous of degree one in the $\xi$ variable. We let
%
\[ K(x,t;y) = \int e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,t;\xi) - y \cdot \xi]} b(x,t;\xi) (1 + |\xi|^2)^{\mu/2}\; d\xi \]
%
denote the kernel. Since $\nabla_\xi \phi(x,t;\xi)$ is homogeneous of degree zero in $\phi$, the sets
%
\[ \Sigma_{(x,t)} = \{ \nabla_\xi \phi(x,t,\xi) : \xi \in \RR^n \} \subset \RR^n_y \]
%
are usually manifolds of dimension $n-1$. They are related to the singular support of $K$.

%Let us for simplicity assume the phase function is nondegenerate, and also, that the resulting Lagrangian manifold $\Sigma \subset T^*(\RR^n_x \times \RR_t \times \RR^n_y)$, the natural projection maps $\Sigma \to T^* \RR^n_y$ and $\Sigma \to \RR^n_{x,t}$ are submersions. It follows that for an open set of $x$ and $t$ we can find a hypersurface $\Sigma_{x,t}$ in the cotangent space of $(x,t)$ upon which the operator behaves

To study the $L^p$ behaviour of $T$, we break up the behaviour of the operator dyadically in the $\xi$ variable, thus setting
%
\[ T = T_{\leq 1} + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty T_n, \]
%
where, for a given $\lambda > 0$, we let $T^\lambda$ be an operator with kernel $K^\lambda$ given by
%
\[ K^\lambda(x,t;\xi) = \int e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,t;\xi) - y \cdot \xi]} b(x,t;\xi) (1 + |\xi|^2)^{\mu/2} \beta(\xi / \lambda)\; d\xi. \]
%
It can be verified that $T_{\leq 1}$ is a pseudo-differential operator of order 0, and is therefore bound on $L^p$ for all $1 < p < \infty$. It therefore suffices to show that as $\lambda \to \infty$,
%
\[ \| T^\lambda f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \lambda^{- \varepsilon} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \]
%
so that we may sum in $n$ in the expansion of $T$ via the triangle inequality to obtain an $L^p$ bound for the original operator.

For large $\lambda$, the principle of stationary phase tells us we should expect $K^\lambda$ to be concentrated in the set
%
\[ \{ (x,t;y) : |\nabla_\xi \phi(x,t;\xi) - y| \leq 1/\lambda\ \text{for some $\xi$} \}, \]
%
since the phase oscillates to a significant degree for $|\nabla \phi(x,t;\xi) - y| \gtrsim 1/\lambda$, roughly a $1/\lambda$ neighborhood of the singular support of $K$. Also we have $\| K^\lambda \|_{L^\infty_x L^\infty_y} \lesssim \lambda^{\mu + d}$ trivially by taking in absolute values. This gives the crude estimate that $\| K_n \|_{L^\infty_x L^1_y} \lesssim \lambda^{\mu + d - 1}$. Thus we obtain by Schur's Lemma that
%
\[ \| T^\lambda f \|_{L^1(\RR^{d+1})} \lesssim \lambda^{\mu + d - 1} \| f \|_{L^1(\RR^d)}. \]

We will get a much better bound by a more sophisticated decomposition of the kernels $\{ K^\lambda \}$.

For a given $\lambda$, let $\{ \xi_\nu^\lambda \}$ be a maximal, $\lambda^{-1/2}$ separated subset of the unit sphere in $\RR^n$, where $\nu$ ranges over some set $\Theta^\lambda$ with $\#(\Theta^\lambda) \sim \lambda^{(d-1)/2}$. Let
%
\[ \Gamma^\lambda_\nu = \{ \xi \in \RR^d_\xi : |\xi \cdot \xi^\lambda_\nu| \geq (1 - c \lambda^{-1/2}) \cdot |\xi| \} \]
%
for some suitably small constant $c > 0$. Let $\{ \chi^\lambda_\nu \}$ be a smooth partition of unity, homogeneous of degree zero, adapted to the $\Gamma^\lambda_\nu$. We thus have
%
\[ |D^\alpha \chi^\lambda_\nu(\xi)| \lesssim_\alpha \lambda^{|\alpha|/2} |\xi|^{1 - \alpha}. \]
%
We thus consider operators $T^\lambda_\nu$ with kernels $K^\lambda_\nu$ given by
%
\[ K^\lambda_\nu(x,t;y) = \int e^{2 \pi i (\phi(x,t;\xi) - y \cdot \xi)} b^\lambda_\nu(x,t;\xi) ( 1 + |\xi|^2 )^{\mu/2} \]
%
where
%
\[ b^\lambda_\nu(x,t;\xi) = b(x,t;\xi) \beta(\xi / \lambda) \chi^\lambda_\nu(\xi). \]
%
Stationary phase again tell us that $K^\lambda_\nu(x,t;y)$ satisfies the bounds
%
\[ |K^\lambda_\nu(x,t;y)| \lesssim_N \frac{\lambda^{\mu + (d+1)/2}}{\langle \lambda | \pi_{\xi^\lambda_\nu} (y - \nabla_\xi \phi(x,t,\xi^\lambda_\nu)| + \lambda^{1/2} | \pi_{\xi^\lambda_\nu}^\perp (y - \nabla_\xi \phi(x,t,\xi^\lambda_\nu)) | \rangle^N}. \]
%
This bound immediately yields via Schur's Lemma that for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$,
%
\[ \| K^\lambda_\nu \|_{L^\infty_{x,t} L^1_y} \lesssim \lambda^\mu, \]
%
and thus that
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^{d+1})} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}, \]
%
a much better bound than was obtained trivially than from the global sum.

We might hope to then combine this still fairly trivial bound with a square function estimate of the form
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^p(\RR^{d+1})} \lesssim_\varepsilon \lambda^\varepsilon \| S^\lambda f \|_{L^p(\RR^{d+1})} \]
%
where
%
\[ S^\lambda f = \left( \sum_\nu | T^\lambda_\nu f |^2 \right)^{1/2}, \]
%
which in some sense, captures the orthogonality of the operators $\{ T^\lambda_\nu \}$. This then yields that for $p \geq 2$, that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^p_{x,t}} &\lesssim_\varepsilon \lambda^\varepsilon \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^p_{x,t} l^2_\nu}\\
    &\leq \lambda^\varepsilon \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^p_{x,t} l^p_\nu}\\
    &= \lambda^\varepsilon \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{l^p_\nu L^p_{x,t})}\\
    &\lesssim \lambda^\varepsilon \lambda^{\mu + (d-1)/2} \#(\Theta^\lambda)^{1/p}\\
    &= \lambda^{\varepsilon + \mu + (d-1) / p},
\end{align*}
%
thus giving bounds for $\mu > (d-1)/2$, i.e., the non-endpoint local smoothing.

Wolff noticed that the non-endpoint local smoothing results could be obtained with a weaker bound than a square function estimate, namely, an \emph{$l^p$ decoupling inequality} of the form
%
\[ \| T^\lambda f \|_{L^p(\RR^{d+1})} \lesssim \lambda^{\alpha(p) + \varepsilon} \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{l^p_\nu L^p_{x,t}}, \]
%
where if $2 \leq p \leq 2(d+1)/(d-1)$, then
%
\[ \alpha(p) = (d-1)|1/p - 1/2|, \] 
%
and for $2(d+1)/(d-1) \leq p < \infty$,
%
\[ \alpha(p) = (d-1)|1/p - 1/2| - 1/p. \]
%
The $L^p$ norm of the localized pieces is much easier to estimate. For instance, we have
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^\infty_{x,t}} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f \|_{L^\infty}, \]
%
and thus
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{l^\infty_\nu L^\infty_{x,t}} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f \|_{L^\infty}. \]
%
On the other hand, we have an $L^2$ energy conservation estimate of the form
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^2_{x,t}} \lesssim \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{L^\infty_t L^2_x} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f^\lambda_\nu \|_{L^2} \]
%
where $f^\lambda_\nu$ is the localization of $f^\lambda_\nu$ on the Fourier side to the support of $\chi^\lambda_\nu$. This immediately yields via Parseval's inequality and orthogonality that
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{l^2_\nu L^2_{x,t}} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f^\lambda_\nu \|_{l^2_\nu L^2_x} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f \|_{L^2_x}. \]
%
Interpolation thus yields that for $2 \leq p \leq \infty$,
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_\nu f \|_{l^p_\nu L^p_{x,t}} \lesssim \lambda^\mu \| f \|_{L^p}, \]
%
and thus that, together with Wolff's decoupling inequality,
%
\[ \| T^\lambda f \|_{L^p(\RR^{d+1})} \lesssim_\varepsilon \lambda^{\alpha(p) + \mu + \varepsilon} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}, \]
%
and thus we get boundedness of $T$ for $\mu < \alpha(p)$, which gives $1/p$ degrees of local smoothing.








\chapter[Kim: Variable Coefficient Generalizations of the RMC]{Kim: Variable-Coefficient Generalizations of the Radial Multiplier Conjecture}

This chapter discusses Jongchon Kim's 2017 paper \emph{Endpoint Bounds for Quasiradial Fourier Multipliers} \cite{KimQuasiradial}, and his 2018 paper \emph{Endpoint Bounds for a Class of Spectral Multipliers on Compact Manifolds} \cite{KimSpectral}. These two papers introduce some useful techniques which can be used to generalize some of the results of Heo-Nasarov-Seeger to variable-coefficient settings.

Lets begin with the results of \cite{KimQuasiradial}. Given a homogeneous function
%
\[ a: \RR^d \to (0,\infty) \]
%
of degree one, smooth away from the origin, the paper discusses the problem of bounding `quasiradial' Fourier multipliers with symbols of the form
%
\[ m(\xi) = h(a(\xi). \]
%
The homogeneity and non-negativity condition implies that the `cosphere'
%
\[ \Sigma = \{ \xi : a(\xi) = 1 \} \]
%
is a smooth hypersurface in $\RR^d$. Under the additional assumption that this surface has everywhere non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, Kim proves that for $d \geq 4$, and $1 < p < 2(d-1)/(d+1)$, if $h$ is a unit scale multiplier, then
%
\[ \| h \circ a \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim C_p(h). \]
%
This is analogous to the result of Heo, Nasarov, and Seeger, but applied to multipliers that are now only \emph{quasi-radial} rather than radial.

Similar results are obtained in \cite{KimSpectral}, but in the setting of compact manifolds. Given a smooth, compact manifold $M$, and a first-order classical, elliptic, formally positive, self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator $P$, such that the cospheres
%
\[ \Sigma_x = \{ \xi \in T_x M : p(x,\xi) = 1 \} \]
%
have non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, Kim proves that, for a unit-scale function $h$ and for $1 < p < 2(d+1)/(d+3)$,
%
\[ \| h \|_{M^{p,q}_{\text{Dil}}(M,P)} \lesssim \| h \|_{B^2_{d(1/p - 1/2),q}(\RR)}, \]
%
This improves results of Seeger and Sogge (1989), who proved the result with $B^{2,q}_{\alpha_p}$ replaced with $L^2_\alpha$ for $\alpha > \alpha_p$, and a result of Seeger (1991), who replaced $B^{2,q}_{\alpha_p}$ with a subspace $R^{2,q}_{\alpha_p}$ consisting of functions which have decompositions similar to the Bochner-Riesz multipliers. TODO: Understand the relation between these two results.

\section{Quasi-Radial Multipliers}

Let's begin by describing the new ideas introduced in \cite{KimQuasiradial}. Let $h$ and $a$ be as above. If $\eta$ is supported on $\{ 1/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 4 \}$, and equal to one on $\{ 1/2 \leq |\xi| \leq 2 \}$, then
%
\begin{align*}
    m(D)f(x) &= \int h(a(\xi)) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot (x - y)} f(y)\; dy\; d\xi\\
    &= \int h(a(\xi)) \eta(a(\xi)) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot (x - y)} f(y)\; dy\; d\xi\\
    &= \int \widehat{h}(t) \eta(a(\xi)) e^{2 \pi i [ \xi \cdot (x - y) + t a(\xi) ]} f(y)\; dy\; d\xi\; dt\\
    &= \int \widehat{h}(t) (K_t * f)(x)\; dx\; dt,
\end{align*}
%
where $K_t$ is the kernel with
%,
\[ \widehat{K}_t(\xi) = \eta(a(\xi)) e^{2 \pi i t a(\xi)}. \]
%
Let's start with some $L^1$ estimates for the kernels $\{ K_t \}$, which do not even use the curvature properties of $\Sigma$.

\begin{theorem}
    \[ \| K_t \|_{L^1(\RR^d)} \lesssim \langle t \rangle^{\frac{d-1}{2}}. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\psi$ be the inverse Fourier transform of the function $\eta(a(\cdot))$. Then the Fourier transform of $\text{Dil}_{1/t} \psi$ is equal to $t^{-d} \text{Dil}_t (\eta \circ a)$. We calculate that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        K_t(tx) &= \int (\eta \circ a)(\xi) e^{2 \pi i [t a(\xi) + \xi \cdot tx]}\; d\xi\\
        &= \int t^{-d} \text{Dil}_t (\eta \circ a)(\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ a(\xi) + \xi \cdot x ]}\; d\xi\\
        &= e^{2 \pi i a(D)} (\text{Dil}_{1/t} \psi) (x).
    \end{align*}
    %
    Thus
    %
    \[ \| K_t \|_{L^1(\RR^d)} = t^{-d} \| e^{2 \pi i a(D)} ( \text{Dil}_{1/t} \psi ) \|_{L^1(\RR^d)}. \]
    %
    The operator $e^{2 \pi i a(D)}$ is a Fourier integral operator on $\RR^d$, whose canonical relation is the conormal bundle to the surface $\Sigma$, which is, in particular, a canonical graph. Thus Theorem 2.2 of \cite{SeegerSoggeStein} implies that
    %
    \[ \| e^{2 \pi i a(D)} ( \text{Dil}_{1/t} f ) \|_{L^1(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| (1 + \Delta)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \{ \text{Dil}_{1/t} f \} \|_{H^1(\RR^d)} \lesssim t^{\frac{d-1}{2}}. \]
    %
    TODO: Finish off.
    % Int e^{2 \pi i [ a(xi) + xi * (x - y) ]}
    % Integral is stationary when Nabla_xi a = (x-y)
    % Then the x derivative is xi
    % And  the y derivative is -xi
    % Canonical relation is the conromal 
\end{proof}

By the curvature hypothesis, for each $z \in \RR^d - \{ 0 \}$, there are exactly two points $\xi_+$ and $\xi_-$ on $\Sigma$ such that $z$ is normal to $\Sigma$ at these points\footnote{To prove at least two such points exist, simply take the maxima and minima of the function $f(\xi) = z \cdot \xi$. The curvature condition on $\Sigma$ implies that any extremal point $\xi^*$ on $\Sigma$ is either a global maxima or a global minima, since $\Sigma$ must, by the curvature condition, always curve away from the hyperplane normal to $z$ at each point.}. Moreover, we can globally parameterize these normal points, such that $z \mapsto \xi_+(z)$ and $z \mapsto \xi_-(z)$ are smooth functions for $z \in \RR^d - \{ 0 \}$. We let
%
\[ \psi_+(z) = \xi_+ \cdot z \quad\text{and}\quad \psi_-(z) = \xi_- \cdot z. \]
%
Now consider the coordinate system $(0,\infty) \times \Sigma \to \RR^d$ given by $(\rho,\omega) \mapsto \rho \omega$. In coordinates, we have
%
\[ d\xi = \rho^{d-1} (\omega \cdot n(\omega)) d\rho d\sigma(\omega), \]
%
We can thus write
%
\begin{align*}
    K_t(z) &= \int \eta(a(\xi)) e^{2 \pi i [ t a(\xi) + \xi \cdot z ]}\; d\xi\\
    &= \int_0^\infty \int_\Sigma \rho^{d-1} \eta(\rho) \left( \langle \omega, n(\omega) \rangle e^{2 \pi i \rho [ t + \omega \cdot z ]} \right)\; d\sigma(\omega)\; d\rho\\
    &= \int_0^\infty \rho^{d-1} \eta(\rho) \Big( b_+(\rho z) e^{2 \pi i \rho (t + \psi_+(z))} + b_-(\rho z) e^{- 2 \pi i \rho (t + \psi_-(z))} \Big)\; d\rho,
\end{align*}
%
where $b_+$ and $b_-$ are symbols of order $-(d-1)/2$, and where $b_+$ and $b_-$ have principal symbols which are scalar multiples of
%
\[ z \mapsto |z|^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \langle \xi_+, n(\xi_+) \rangle\; \quad\text{and}\quad z \mapsto |z|^{-\frac{d-1}{2}} \langle \xi_-, n(\xi_-) \rangle \]
%
respectively. Exploiting the oscillation of $e^{2 \pi i \rho (t + \psi_+(z))}$ and $e^{-2 \pi i \rho (t + \psi_-(z))}$, integrating by parts, we conclude that for all $N \geq 0$,
%
\begin{equation} \label{KtDecayEquation}
    |K_t(z)| \lesssim_N (1 + |t| + |x|)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{\pm} \langle t + \psi_{\pm}(x) \rangle^{-N}.
\end{equation}
%
We note that $\psi_+(x) \geq 0 \geq \psi_-(x)$, that both functions are homogeneous of degree one, and that in the basic situation where $\Sigma$ is the unit sphere, i.e. when $a(\xi) = |\xi|$,
%
\[ \psi_+(x) = x \quad\text{and}\quad \psi_-(x) = -x. \]
%
For $t > 0$, we thus see that \eqref{KtDecayEquation} reads
%
\[ |K_t(z)| \lesssim_N (1 + |t| + |x|)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \langle t + \psi_-(x) \rangle^{-N}. \]
%
Similarily, we can apply Parseval's identity, together with the fact that

\[ \widehat{K}_t(\zeta) = \eta(a(\zeta)) e^{2 \pi i t a(\zeta)}, \]
%
to conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    &\int K_{t_0}(x - x_0) \overline{K_{t_1}(x - x_1)}\; dx\\
    &\quad\quad\quad= \int |\eta(a(\zeta))|^2 e^{2 \pi i [ (x_0 - x_1) \cdot \zeta + (t_0 - t_1) a(\zeta) ]},
\end{align*}
%
and similar stationary phase estimates to above show that for $N \geq 0$,
%
\begin{align*}
    & \left| \int K_{t_0}(x - x_0) \overline{K_{t_1}(x - x_1)}\; dx \right|\\
    &\quad\quad\quad \lesssim_N (1 + |x_0 - x_1| + |t_0 - t_1|)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{\pm} \langle (t_0 - t_1) + \phi_{\pm}(x_0 - x_1) \rangle^{-N}.
\end{align*}

\begin{remark}
    Using \eqref{KtDecayEquation}, one sees the kernels $K_t$ decay rapidly away from
    %
    \[ \{ x : |t + \psi_-(x)| \leq 1 \}, \]
    %
    a set well approximated by an annulus of thickness $O(1)$ and radius $\sim t$, in particular having measure $O(t^{d-1})$. On this set, $K_t$ has magnitude $O(t^{-\frac{d-1}{2}})$. This gives an alternate method to obtain the $L^1$ bound
    %
    \[ \| K_t \|_{L^1(\RR^d)} \lesssim t^{d-1} t^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} = t^{\frac{d-1}{2}}, \]
    %
    that was obtained without the use of the curvature hypothesis.
\end{remark}

Together with a discretization argument, and the density decomposition arguments introduced in Heo-Nazarov-Seeger, the result follows. One slight difference is that, since we are using the half-wave equation formalism, our discretized estimates have slightly different weights, corresponding to the definition of $C_p(h)$. Indeed, it is proved that
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{n \geq 2} K_{n + u} * f(n, \cdot) \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \Big\| (1 + n + u)^{s_p} f(n + u,y) \Big\|_{l^p_n(\NN) L^p_y(\RR^d)}, \]
%
uniformly for $0 \leq u \leq 1$. Applying Minkowski's inequality, and the fact that $L^1[0,1] \leq L^p[0,1]$,
%
\begin{align*}
    \left\| \int_2^\infty (K_t * f)(t, \cdot)\; dt \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} & \lesssim \Big\| \sum_{n \geq 2} K_{n + u} * f(n+u,\cdot) \Big\|_{L^1_u[0,1] L^p(\RR^d)}\\
    &\leq \Big\| \sum_{n \geq 2} K_{n + u} * f(n+u,\cdot) \Big\|_{L^p_u[0,1] L^p(\RR^d)}\\
    &\lesssim \Big\| (1 + n+u)^{s_p} f(n + u,y) \|_{L^p_u[0,1] l^p_n(\NN) L^p_y(\RR^d)}\\
    &= \left( \iint_{t \geq 1} (1 + t)^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)} |f(t,y)|^p\; dt\; dy \right)^{1/p}.
\end{align*}
%
The right hand side of this inequality is comparable to $C_p(h)$ times $\| g \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ if $f(t,y) = \widehat{m}(t) g(y)$, in which case the computed quantity is essentially the $L^p$ norm of $m(a(D)) \{ g \}$. This inequality is equivalent to the boundedness of the convolution kernel in terms of $C_p(h)$.

Next, discretization is done in the $y$-variable. To prove the inequality above, it suffices to show that for functions $b_{n,z}$ concentrated on neighborhoods of $z \in \ZZ^d$,
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{z \in \ZZ^d} c(n,z) (K_n * b_{n,z}) \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \Big\| c(n,z) (1 + n)^{s_p} \Big\|_{l^p_n l^p_z}. \]
%
For interpolation purposes, it is better to reweight this inequality as
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{z \in \ZZ^d} (1 + n)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} c(n,z) (K_n * b_{n,z}) \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum_n \sum_n |c(n,z)|^p (1 + n)^{d-1} \right)^{1/p}. \]

\section{Spectral Multipliers}

The result of \cite{KimSpectral} uses similar techniques, combined with the Lax parametrix to substitute for the convolution kernel decomposition possible in \cite{KimQuasiradial} because of the translation invariance of the operators studied.

In the proof, by a partition of unity argument, it suffices to prove the result assuming that our inputs functions $f$ lie in $L^p(\Omega_0)$, where $\Omega_0$ is a compact subset of $M$ contained in a single coordinate chart $\Omega$ of $M$. It will help to fix a compact set $\Omega_1$ whose interior contains $\Omega_0$.

To prove the result, we write
%
\[ m(P / R) f = \int [R \widehat{m}(R\xi) ] e^{2 \pi i t P} f. \]
%
Write $m = \sum_{j \geq 0} m_j$, where for $j > 0$, $m_j$ is a Littlewood-Paley cutoff on an annulus at a scale $2^j$, and $m_0$ is a Littlewood-Paley cutoff on the unit ball.

For $2^j \lesssim 1$, we can reduce the study of the operators $m_j(P/R)$ to symbol estimates. For $2^j \gtrsim R$, one can use the local constancy property of the multipliers, together with $L^p(M)$ to $L^2(M)$ by using the fact that $M$ is compact, and thus has finite volume, and then apply orthogonality, to obtain the boundedness of $m_j(P/R)$. We mainly concentrate on the new techniques for controlling the interactions between the multipliers $\{ m_j : 1 \lesssim j \lesssim \log R \}$.

We're going to need some even, smooth cutoff functions $\eta \prec \eta' \prec \eta''$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\eta$ is supported on $\{ |\lambda| \in [1/4,4] \}$, and equal to one on $\{ |\lambda| \in [1/2,2] \}$.

    \item $\eta'$ is supported on $\{ |\lambda| \in [1/6,6] \}$, and equal to one on $\{ |\lambda| \in [1/4,4] \}$.

    \item $\eta''$ is supported on $\{ |\lambda| \in [1/16,16] \}$, and equal to one on $\{ |\lambda| \in [1/8,8] \}$.
\end{itemize}
%
We let $\eta_j, \eta'_j$, and $\eta''_j$ denote the dilations of these cutoffs by $2^j$.

It will help us to localize the function $f$ to the eigenband $\lambda \sim R$. For $f \in L^p(\Omega_0)$, we can write
%
\[ \eta''(P/R) f = S_R f + A_R f, \]
%
where $\| A_R f \|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} \| f \|_{L^p(\Omega_0)}$ for all $f \in L^p(\Omega_0)$, and where $S_R f$ is supported on $\Omega_1$ for $f \in L^p(\Omega_0)$.

We could conclude our argument if we could show that
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{1 \lesssim j \lesssim \log R} m_j(P/R) f \right\|_{L^{p,q}(M)} \lesssim \| m \|_{B_{\alpha_p}^{2,q}(\RR)} \| f \|_{L^p(\Omega_0)}, \]
%
for all functions $f \in L^p(\Omega_0)$. We claim this result follows from the following proposition.

\begin{lemma}
    Fix a family of functions $\{ b_j: 1 \lesssim j \lesssim \log R \}$ such that:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\| b_j \|_{L^2(\RR)} \lesssim 1$.

        \item $\widehat{b}_j$ was supported on $\{ |t| \sim 2^j \}$.

        \item For any $n$ and $M$, and $|\lambda| \not \in [1/8, 8]$,
        %
        \[ |\partial^n b_j(\lambda)| \lesssim_{n,M} 2^{-jM} \langle 2^j \lambda \rangle^{-M}. \]
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Then for functions $\{ f_j \}$ in $L^p(\Omega_0)$,
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_j 2^{jd/2} b_j(P/R) \{ S_R f_j \} \right\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \lesssim \left( \sum_j 2^{jd} \| f_j \|_{L^p(M)}^p \right)^{1/p}. \]
    %
    It follows simply from this that
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_j 2^{jd/2} b_j(P/R) f_j \right\|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim \left( \sum_j 2^{jd} \| f_j \|_{L^p(\Omega_0)}^p \right)^{1/p}. \]
    %
    An interpolation lemma (Lemma 2.4 of Lee, Rogers, and Seeger) yields a square function estimate of the form.
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_j 2^{-jd(1/p - 1/2)} b_j(P/R) f_j \right\|_{L^{p,q}(M)} \lesssim \left\| \left( |f_j|^q \right)^{1/q} \right\|_{L^p(\Omega_0)} \]
\end{lemma}

How does this result imply the required inequality? We can write
%
\[ m_j = \eta_j(D) m_j = \eta_j(D) \left\{ m_j \eta' \right\} + \eta_j(D) \left\{ m_j (1 - \eta') \right\}. \]
%
The multipliers $\eta_j(D) \{ m_j (1 - \eta') \}$ are rapidly decaying (TODO: I Can't see intuitively why this should be the case), so it's easy to bound the corresponding multiplier operators. We therefore reduce our required estimate to
%
\[ \left\| \sum_j [ \eta_j(D) \{ m_j \eta' \} ](P/R) f \right\|_{L^{p,q}(M)} \lesssim \| m \|_{B^{2,q}_{\alpha_p}(\RR)} \| f \|_{L^p(\Omega)}, \]
%
for $f$ supported on $\Omega$. If $b_j = \| m_j \|_{L^2(\RR)}^{-1} \eta_j(D) \{ m_j \eta' \}$, then $\{ b_j \}$ satisfies the assumptions of the lemma above, and the interpolated result, with $f_j = 2^{j \alpha_p} \| m_j \|_{L^2(\RR)} f$.

The Lemma will be proved by a reduction to a restricted weak-type inequality, namely, that for any family of finite subsets $\mathcal{E}_j$ of $(\ZZ / R)^d$, 
%
\[ \left\| \sum_j 2^{jd/2} \sum_{n \in \mathcal{E}_j} b_j(P/R) \chi_{j,n} \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}(\Omega)} \lesssim R^{-d/p} \left( \sum_j 2^{jd} \# \mathcal{E}_j \right)^{1/p}. \]

We will mainly focus now on the $L^2$ estimates that imply this restricted weak-type inequality.

For a fixed $\alpha > 0$, we cover $\RR^d$ by essentially disjoint cubes with sidelength $2^j / R$, and denote the collection of cubes in $\mathcal{Q}_j$. Let $\mathcal{Q}_j(\lambda)$ be the collection of all $Q \in \mathcal{Q}_j$ such that $Q \cap \# \mathcal{E}_j > \lambda^p$. This allows us to write
%
\[ \mathcal{E}_j = \mathcal{E}^{\text{High}}_j(\lambda) \cup \mathcal{E}^{\text{Low}}_j(\lambda), \]
%
where $\mathcal{E}^{\text{High}}_j(\lambda)$ is the collection of points in $\mathcal{E}_j$ that lie in a cube $Q$ lying in $\mathcal{Q}_j(\lambda)$, i.e. the set of `high density points'. Fix $C > 0$ suitably large, and for each cube $Q$, let $Q^*$ denote the cube with the same center as $Q$, but $C$ times the sidelength. Then
%
\[ \sum_j \sum_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_j(\lambda)} |Q| \lesssim \sum_j \sum_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_j} (2^{jd} / R) \alpha^{-p} \#( \mathcal{E}_j \cap Q ) \leq \alpha^{-p} \sum_j 2^{jd} t^{-d} \#(\mathcal{E}_j). \]
%
This inequality shows that it is fair to throw out the union of the cubes in $\mathcal{Q}_j(\lambda)$ in the analysis of the measure of the set
%
\[ \left\{ x \in \Omega : \left| \sum_j 2^{jd/2} \sum_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_j(\lambda)} b_j(P/R) \chi_{j,n} \right| > \alpha \right\}. \]
%
The required bound would follow if we could show that
%
\[ \lambda^{-1} \sum_j 2^{jd/2} \left\| \sum_{Q \in \mathcal{Q}_j(\lambda)} [ b_j(P/R) \chi_{j,Q} ] \mathbf{I}_{(Q^*)^c} \right\|_{L^1(\Omega)} \lesssim \lambda^{-p} \sum_j 2^{jd} R^{-d} \# \mathcal{E}_j. \]
%
But (see end of Section 5.1 for more details), this follows from the fact that the Lax parametrix is supported on a small neighborhood of the diagonal.

We are now left with the analysis of $\mathcal{E}_j^{\text{Low}}(\lambda)$. To simplify notation, we will assume that $\mathcal{E}_j = \mathcal{E}_j^{\text{Low}}(\lambda)$ for all $j$. We will try and control
%
\[ \left\| \sum_j 2^{jd/2} \sum_{n \in \mathcal{E}_j} b_j(P/R) \chi_{j,n} \right\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 \lesssim \alpha^{2 - p} \log \alpha \sum_j 2^{jd} R^{-d} \# \mathcal{E}_j. \]
%
Define $G_j = \sum_{n \in \mathcal{E}_j} b_j(P/R) f_{j,n}$. Then, applying the triangle inequality for $j \lesssim \log \alpha$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| \sum_j 2^{jd/2} G_j \|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 \lesssim \log \alpha \left( \sum_j 2^{jd} \| G_j \|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 + \sum_j \sum_{\log \alpha \lesssim k \lesssim j} 2^{ \frac{k+j}{2} } |\langle G_j, G_k \rangle| \right). \]
%
We will bound each of these quantities separately.

First, let's bounded $\| G_j \|_{L^2(\Omega)}$.







Let us suppose the Lax parametrix applies on times $|t| \leq \varepsilon$. Times larger than this are dealt with fairly simply

We can apply the Lax parametrix for times $|t| \leq \varepsilon$. The large times are dealt with easily, using compactness to reduce $L^p(M)$ estimates to $L^2(M)$ estimates, and then applying orthogonality. Similarily, small times can also be dealt with by reducing to the study of pseudodifferential operators.

%Write

%
%Parametrix methods can only understand the wave equation $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} f \}$ for times $|t| \lesssim 1$. When studying multipliers on manifolds. But this is often fine, because our assumptions normally allow for greater control on $\widehat{m}$ for large times. Here are some approaches we can do:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Since $M$ is compact, it has finite volume, so we can reduce our $L^p$ estimates to $L^2$ estimates if $p \leq 1$ and then use orthogonality, concluding that

\chapter{Radial Multipliers On The Sphere}

Let us now try and prove certain special cases of the radial multiplier conjectures on the sphere $S^d$, i.e. multipliers of the operator $P = \sqrt{-\Delta}$. We fix a unit scale function $h$, and study operators of the form
%
\[ h \left( P / R \right) = \sum\nolimits_\lambda h(\lambda / R) \mathcal{P}_\lambda, \]
%
where $\mathcal{P}_\lambda$, for $\lambda > 0$, is the orthogonal projection operator onto the eigenspace of $P$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$. In particular, we wish to characterize the boundedness properties of the operators $h(P/R)$, in terms of appropriate control of the Fourier transform of the function $h$. For a given exponent $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, let $\alpha_p = (d-1)|1/p - 1/2|$. For $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$, let us assume that
%
\[ C_p(h) = \left( \int_0^\infty \left[ \langle t \rangle^{\alpha_p} |\widehat{h}(t)| \right]^p\; dt \right)^{1/p} \]
%
is finite. By Mitjagin's transference principle \cite{Mitjagin}, and because the finiteness of $C_p(h)$ is necessary for $h(|\cdot|)$ to be a bounded Fourier multiplier on $L^p(\RR^d)$, we have $C_p(h) \lesssim \| h \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| h \|_{M^p_{\text{Dil}}(S^d)}$. The boundedness of $C_p(h)$ has already been proved sufficient provided the inputs are restricted to \emph{zonal} functions \cite{Alladi}. The main result of this paper is to extend these bounds to general inputs.

\begin{theorem} \label{MainSphereTheorem}
    Suppose $1 \leq p < 2d/(d+1)$. If $h$ is a unit scale multiplier, then
    %
    \[ \| h \|_{M^p_{\text{Dil}}(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h), \]
    %
    i.e. for $f \in L^p(S^d)$,
    %
    \[ \| h(P/R) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniform in the input $f$, the symbol $h$, and the scaling parameter $R$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remarks}
    \ 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $1 \leq p < 2d/(d+1)$ and $C_p(h) < \infty$, then \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} implies that the operator $h(|\cdot|)$ is bounded as a Fourier multiplier operator on $L^p(\RR^d)$ with
    %
    \[ \| h(|\cdot|) \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim C_p(h). \]
    %
    Interpolation and duality (see Section 2.5.5 of \cite{Grafakos} for more details) implies that the operator is also a Fourier multiplier operator on $L^2(\RR^d)$, and so we conclude that
    %
    \[ \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} = \| h( |\cdot| ) \|_{M^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim C_p(h). \]

    \item The projection operators $\{ \mathcal{P}_\lambda \}$ are each individually smoothing, though not uniformly as $\lambda \to \infty$. They thus individually satisfy bounds of the form $\| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim_\lambda \| f \|_{L^p(M)}$ for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. It thus follows trivially from the triangle inequality, and that there are finitely many eigenvalues for $P$ in $[0,100]$, that for any $R \leq 100$,
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| M_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} &\leq \sum_\lambda |h(\lambda/R)| \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^p(S^d)}\\
        &\leq \| h \|_{L^\infty(0,200)} \sum\nolimits_{\lambda \in [0,200]} \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^p(S^d)}\\
        &\lesssim \| h \|_{L^\infty(0,\infty)} \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Thus, in the analysis that follows, we will always assume that $R \geq 100$.

    \item Because $h$ is a unit scale multiplier, if we fix a smooth bump function $\beta$ supported on $\{ 1/4 \leq |t| \leq 4 \}$, and equal to one on $\{ 1/2 \leq |t| \leq 2 \}$, set $\beta_R(\lambda) = \beta(\lambda / R)$, and set $Q_R = \beta(P/R)$, then
    %
    \[ h(P/R) = Q_R \circ h(P/R) \circ Q_R. \]
    %
    By including the operators $\{ Q_R \}$ in our analysis, we essentially reduce our analysis to the study to inputs and outputs lying in the range of the operators $Q_R$, which is equal to the finite dimensional subspace $V_R$ of $C^\infty(S^d)$ spanned by eigenfunctions of $P$ with eigenvalue in $R/4 \leq \lambda \leq 4R$. Since $P$ is positive-semidefinite and self-adjoint, it is often useful to use the heuristic that an element of $V_R$ should behave like a function on $\RR^d$ with Fourier support on $\{ R/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 4R \}$.

    A particular application of this heuristic is an analogue of Bernstein's inequality on $\RR^d$ (see \cite{Wolff},  Proposition 5.1), but for functions on a Riemannian manifold lying in $V_R$. This analogue states that for $1 < r < \infty$, uniformly for $R \geq 100$ and $f \in V_R$ we have
    %
    \begin{equation} \label{ManifoldBernsteinInequality}
        \| f \|_{L^r_s(S^d)} \lesssim_{r,s} R^s \| f \|_{L^r(S^d)}.
    \end{equation}
    %
    See Section 3.3 of \cite{Sogge} for a proof.

    Another useful inequality follows from the fact that the family of functions $\{ \beta_R \}$ form a uniformly bounded subset of the Fr\'{e}chet space $\mathcal{S}^0$, i.e. satisfying estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |\partial_\lambda^n \{ \beta_R \}(\lambda)| \lesssim_n \langle \lambda \rangle^{-n} \quad\text{uniformly in $R > 0$}. \]
    %
    It follows that the operators $\{ Q_R \}$ are pseudodifferential operators of order zero, uniformly bounded as operators on $L^r_s(M)$ for all $1 < r < \infty$, i.e. satisfying
    %
    \begin{equation}
        \| Q_R f \|_{L^r_s(S^d)} \lesssim_{r,s} \| f \|_{L^r_s(S^d)}.
    \end{equation}
    %
    See Corollary 4.3.2 of \cite{Sogge} for more details.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks}

\begin{comment}

Our remarks reduce Theorem \ref{MainSphereTheorem} to the following statement.

\begin{theorem} \label{RestrictedMainSphereTheorem}
    Suppose $1 \leq p < 2d/(d+1)$. If $R \geq 100$, then for $f \in V_R$,
    %
    \[ \| M_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniform in $f$, $h$, and $R$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof that Theorem \ref{RestrictedMainSphereTheorem} implies Theorem \ref{MainSphereTheorem}]
    Remark 2 shows that the analysis of $\{ M_R \}$ for $R \leq 100$ is trivial. For any $f \in L^p(S^d)$, $Q_R f \in V_R$, we conclude from Remark 3 that
    %
    \[ \| M_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} = \| M_R (Q_R f) \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| Q_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}. \]
    %
    We have thus obtained the required bound for general inputs.
\end{proof}

%In microlocal analysis, it is often handy to work with Schwartz operators $T$ \emph{modulo smoothing operators}, i.e. modulo Schwartz operators whose kernels are smooth. This simplifies many calculations, including those involving $L^p$ estimates, since the set of all pairs $(p,q)$ such that $T$ maps $L^p_c$ into $L^q_{\text{loc}}$ is stable modulo the smoothing operators. Since we are proving estimates parameterized by a family $R$, we augment this terminology slightly. We will say a family of operators $\{ T_R \}$ is \emph{uniformly smoothing} if the kernels $\{ K_R \}$ satisfy estimates of the form
%
%\[ |\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta K_R(x,y)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta} 1 \]
%
%where the implicit constant is independent of $R$. The set of all pairs $(p,q)$ such that $\{ T_R \}$ maps $L^p_c$ uniformly into $L^q_{\text{loc}}$ is then preserved modulo uniformly smoothing operators. If, we have the stronger condition that
%
%\[ |\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta K_R(x,y)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,N} R^{-N} \]
%
%for all $N \geq 0$, we say the operators $\{ T_R \}$ are \emph{uniformly negligible}. Such a bound becomes more useful than mere uniform smoothness in arguments where we decompose the operator $T_R$ into a sum of $O(R^\alpha)$ different operators, since modifying each of these operators by a uniformly negligible 

%In order to deal with certain remainder terms that arise in our calculations, it will be useful to keep some naive bounds on the $L^p$ norm of $M_R f$ handy.

%\begin{lemma} \label{SmoothInputBounds}
%    If $s > 2d$, then for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and for any function $j: [0,\infty) \to \CC$, and set $J_R = j(P / R)$. Then
    %
%    \begin{equation} \label{SmoothInputInequality1}
%        \| J_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim_s \| j \|_{L^\infty([0,\infty))} \| f \|_{L^2_s(S^d)}.
%    \end{equation}
    %
%    If $h: [0,\infty) \to \CC$ is a unit scale multiplier, and $M_R = h(P/R)$, then
    %
%    \begin{equation} \label{SmoothInputInequality2}
%        \| M_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim_s R^s\; \| h \|_{L^\infty} \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}.
%    \end{equation} 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%    Without loss of generality, since $S^d$ has finite measure, in the proof of \eqref{SmoothInputInequality1} we may assume $p = \infty$. Fix $0 < \varepsilon < s - 2d$. Using Sobolev embeddings, if $f \in C^\infty(S^d)$ we calculate that
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} &\lesssim \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^2_{d+\varepsilon}(S^d)}\\
%        &\lesssim \| (1 + P)^{d+\varepsilon} \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^2(S^d)}\\
%        &\lesssim \lambda^{d+\varepsilon} \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim \lambda^{d+\varepsilon-s} \| f \|_{L^2_s(S^d)}.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    The Weyl law implies that for $k \geq 1$, there are $O(2^{kd})$ eigenvalues of $P$ in the interval $[2^k,2^{k+1}]$, and so
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        \left\| J_R f \right\|_{L^\infty(S^d)} &\lesssim \| j \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \left( \| \mathcal{P}_0 f \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} + \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{2^k \leq \lambda \leq 2^{k+1}} \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda f \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} \right)\\
%        &\lesssim \| j \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \Big( 1 + \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 2^{kd} 2^{k(d+\varepsilon - s)} \Big) \| f \|_{L^2_s(S^d)}\\
%        &\lesssim \| j \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \| f \|_{L^2_s(S^d)}.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    Thus we have proved \eqref{SmoothInputInequality1}. To prove \eqref{SmoothInputInequality2}, we again apply the Weyl law, i.e. that there are $O(R^d)$ eigenvalues of $P$ on the support of $h(\cdot / R)$, which gives
    %
%    \[ \| M_R f \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} \lesssim \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \| f \|_{L^2_s(S^d)}. \]
    %
%    For $f \in V_R$, Bernstein's inqeuality implies that $\| f \|_{L^2_s(S^d)} \lesssim R^s \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)}$, which yields
    %
%    \[ \| M_R f \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} \lesssim R^s \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)}. \]
    %
%    For general inputs, the same inequality follows by the fact that $M_R = M_R \circ Q_R$, and that the operators $\{ Q_R \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^2(S^d)$.

%    we start by making the assumption that $1 \leq p \leq 2$. If we use \eqref{SmoothInputInequality1}, we conclude that for $f \in L^p(S^d)$, with $g = Q_R f$,
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        \| M_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} = \| M_R g \|_{L^p(S^d)} &\lesssim \| h \|_{L^\infty} \| g \|_{L^2_s(S^d)}\\
%        &\lesssim R^s \| h \|_{L^\infty} \| g \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim R^s \| h \|_{L^\infty} \| f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    Now that the result has been proved for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, the result for $2 \leq p \leq \infty$ is immediately implied by duality, since $h(P)^* = \overline{h}(P)$, and $\| \overline{h} \|_{L^\infty} = \| h \|_{L^\infty}$.
%    \end{comment}
%\end{proof}

% Later on in our analysis, we will reduce our analysis to the study of various Fourier integral operators. The composition calculus of Fourier integral operators will show that this assumption also allows us to show the behaviour of these operators is mainly determined by the behaviour of the integral defining the operators over values of the phase variables roughly proportional to $R$.

To exploit the fact that $C_p(h)$ is finite in the proof, we must employ the Fourier transform of $h$ in some way. A standard method is to apply the Fourier inversion formula to write
%
\[ h(P/R) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
where
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t P} = \sum_\lambda e^{2 \pi i t \lambda} \mathcal{P}_\lambda \]
%
is the multiplier operator on $S^d$ which, as $t$ varies, gives solutions to the half-wave equation
%
\[ \partial_t - i P = 0. \]
%
%
%\[ M_R = 2 \int_0^\infty R \widehat{h}(Rt) \cos(2 \pi t P)\; dt, \]
%
%where
%
%\[ \cos(2 \pi t P) = \sum_\lambda \cos(2 \pi t \lambda) \mathcal{P}_\lambda \]
%
%is the Fourier multiplier giving solutions to the wave equation
%
%\[ \partial_t^2 u + (2 \pi P)^2 = 0. \]
%
%
%
%We begin by listing some fixed time bounds for the propogators $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$. The propogators are unitary, so for $t \in \RR$,
%
%\[ \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|_{L^2(S^d)} = \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)}. \]
%
%For $1 < p < \infty$, we have
%
%\[ \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim_{p,t_0} \| f \|_{L^p_{\alpha_p}(S^d)} \quad\text{uniformly for $t > 0$}, \]
%
%which follows from Corollary 6.2.3 of \cite{Sogge}, and the periodicity of the wave propogators $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$.
%
Our goal is thus to study the regularity properties of averages of the half-wave operator.

Consider a cover
%
\[ \{ |t| < 100/R \} \cup \{ 50/R < |t| < 1/100 \} \cup \{ 1/200 < |t| < \infty \} \]
%
of $\RR$, and find a smooth partition of unity $\chi_{I,R}$, $\chi_{II,R}$, and $\chi_{III,R}$ adapted to these sets. Without loss of generality, we may assume all three functions are even, that $\chi_{I,R}(t) = \chi_I(Rt)$, for some smooth, compactly supported function $\chi_I$ adapted to the open set $\{ |t| < 1 \}$, and also assume that $\chi_{III,R} = \chi_{III}$ is independent of $R$. Given this partition of unity, we now write
%
\[ h(P/R) = I_R + II_R + III_R, \]
%
where, for $\Pi \in \{ I, II, III \}$, the operators
%
\[ \Pi_R = \int \chi_{\Pi,R}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt \]
%
isolate the study of $h(P/R)$ to the behaviour of the half-wave propogators on three different time intervals. The remainder of the argument will consist of separately obtaining $L^p$ boundedness for each of the three operators $Q_R \circ \Pi_R \circ Q_R$, since then the triangle inequality gives the $L^p$ boundedness of
%
\begin{align*}
    (Q_R \circ I_R \circ Q_R) + (Q_R \circ II_R \circ Q_R) + &(Q_R \circ II_R \circ Q_R) = h(P/R).
\end{align*}
%
The study of the operators $\{ I_R \}$ will reduce to a study of pseudodifferential operators, we will be able to apply the endpoint local smoothing inequality of \cite{LeeSeeger} to control the operators $\{ III_R \}$, and the study of the operators $\{ II_R \}$ will be given by generalizations of the methods of \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} to a variable coefficient setting.




\section{Analysis of $I_R$}

Let us analyze
%
\[ I_R = \int \chi_I(Rt) R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt. \]
%
We are analyzing inputs to $I_R$ coming from the composition of a general element of $C^\infty(S^d)$ with $Q_R$, which heuristically localizes the `frequency support' of this function to a band of frequencies with magnitude $\sim R$. Thus, by uncertainty principle heuristics, such functions are locally constant at a scale $1/R$. The half-wave equation propogates a majority of the mass of it's input at a unit speed, and since the operators $\{ I_R \}$ are obtained by averaging the half-wave equation over times $\lesssim 1/R$, we should expect that the behaviour of the operators $\{ I_R \}$ to behave in a localized manner. In fact, the following analysis will show that the operators $\{ I_R \}$ are pseudodifferential operators, which will allow us to conclude these operators are uniformly bounded in $L^p(S^d)$.

\begin{comment}

This result follows from the following Lemma.

\begin{lemma}
    For each $m \in \mathcal{S}^0(\RR)$, and each $R > 0$, the operator $m(P/R)$ is a pseudodifferential operator of order $0$. Moreover, if we fix a coordinate chart $x: U \to V$ from an open subset $U \subset M$ of our manifold $M$ onto $V \subset \RR^d$, and let $s_R \in \mathcal{S}^0(T^* V)$ denote it's symbol in the coordinate chart, i.e. the symbol of the pseudodifferential operator $(x^{-1})^* \circ m(P/R) \circ x^*$ on $\DD(V)$, then the family of symbols $\{ s_R : R \geq 1 \}$ forms a bounded subset of $\mathcal{S}^0(T^* V)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We apply the Hadamard parametrix. Let $0 < \varepsilon_0 < T_{\text{max}}$ such that for each $\sigma \in \{ +, - \}^2$, the interval $[0, 10 \varepsilon_0]$ is disjoint from $\text{supp}_\tau a_\sigma$. Consider an even function $\rho \in \mathcal{S}(\RR)$ such that
    %
    \[ \text{supp} \left( \widehat{\rho} \right) \subset [0,\varepsilon_0], \]
    %
    and such that $\widehat{\rho}(t) = 1$ for $|t| \leq \varepsilon_0 / 2$. Set $m_R(\lambda) = m(\lambda / R)$. Then
    %
    \[ m_R(P) = (m_R * \rho)(P) + (m_R * (\delta - \rho))(P). \]
    %
    We will analyze each of these operators separately.

    Let $r_R = m_R * (\delta - \rho)$. Since $m$ is a symbol of order zero, we have
    %
    \[ |D^\alpha_t \widehat{m}(t)| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} |t|^{-1-\alpha-N} \quad\text{for all $N \geq 0$}. \]
    %
    Since
    %
    \[ \widehat{r}_R(t) = \widehat{m}_R(t) (1 - \widehat{\rho}(t)) = [R \widehat{m}(Rt)] (1 - \widehat{\rho}(t)), \]
    %
    which vanishes for $|t| \leq \varepsilon_0 / 2$, we conclude from the estimates above and the product rule that
    %
    \[ |D^M_t \{ \widehat{r}_R(t) \} | \lesssim_N R^{-N} \langle t \rangle^{-1 - M - N} \quad\text{for all $N \geq 0$}. \]
    %
    But inverting the Fourier transform thus gives that
    %
    \[ |r_R(\lambda)| \lesssim_{N,M} R^{- N} \lambda^{-M} \quad\text{for all $M + N > 0$}. \]
    %
    If $\phi$ is a normalized bump function supported on $[-1,+1]$, then for $0 \leq T \leq \varepsilon$,
    %
    \[ \int \widehat{r}_R(t) \phi(t / T)\; dt = \int [R\widehat{m}(Rt)] (1 - \widehat{\rho}(t)) \phi(t/T)\; dt = 0, \]
    %
    and for $\varepsilon \leq T \leq 1$, and for $N > 1$,
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \left| \widehat{r}_R(t) \phi(t/T)\; dt \right| &= \left| \int [R\widehat{m}(Rt)] (1 - \widehat{\rho}(t)) \phi(t/T)\; dt \right|\\
        &\lesssim_\varepsilon \left| \int m_R(\lambda) \widehat{\phi}(T \lambda) \right| + \left| \int m_R(\lambda) \int \rho(\lambda - \tau) \widehat{\phi}(T \tau) \right|\\
        &\lesssim_N \int |m(\lambda / R)| \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N}\; d\lambda \leq \| m \|_{L^\infty}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    The uniformity here in $T$ and $R$ implies (see Stein, Chapter 6, Proposition 3) that the family $\{ r_R : R > 0 \}$ are a family of symbols of order zero, uniformly bounded in $\mathcal{S}^0(\RR)$, so that in particular, we also have the estimate
    %
    \[ |r_R(t)| \lesssim_N 1. \]
    %
    Let $X_R$ be the space spanned by eigenfunctions to $P$ with eigenvalues in $[0,R]$. We split our proof into two cases.
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $R \geq 1$, $\dim(X_R) \lesssim R^d$. Consider any orthonormal basis $\{ e_{R,j} \}$ to $X_R$ with $P e_{R,j} = \lambda_{R,j} e_{R,j}$. Crude Sobolev embedding techniques imply that for each $f \in X_R$,
        %
        \[ \| D^\alpha_x f \|_{L^\infty(M)} \lesssim_\alpha R^{|\alpha| + d/2 + 1} \| f \|_{L^2(M)}. \]
        %
        But from this, we conclude that for $M > d$,
        %
        \begin{align*}
            |D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y r_R(P)(x,y)| &\leq \sum_j |r_R(\lambda_{R,j})| |D^\alpha_x e_j(x)| |D^\beta_y e_j(y)|\\
            &\lesssim_{N,M,\alpha,\beta} R^{M - N} \sum_j \lambda_{R,j}^{-M} R^{|\alpha| + d/2 + 1} R^{|\beta| + d/2 + 1}\\
            &\lesssim R^{d + 2 + M - N + |\alpha| + |\beta|} \sum_j \lambda_{R,j}^{-M}\\
            &\lesssim R^{d + 2 + M - N + |\alpha| + |\beta|}.
        \end{align*}
        %
        Taking $N > d + 2 + M + |\alpha| + |\beta|$ gives that
        %
        \[ |D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y r_R(P)(x,y)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta} 1. \]

        \item If $R \leq 1$, then $\dim(X_R) \lesssim 1$. Then for any $f \in X_R$,
        %
        \[ \| D^\alpha_x f \|_{L^\infty(M)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^2(M)}. \]
        %
        But this implies, as above, instead using the uniform bound $|r_R(t)| \lesssim 1$, that
        %
        \[ |D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y r_R(P)(x,y)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta} 1. \]
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Thus $\{ r_R : R > 0 \}$ is a family of smoothing operators, uniformly in $R$.





    Now we discuss $(m_R * \rho)(P)$, which is now frequency localized to within the scope where we can apply the Lax parametrix to write
    %
    \[ (m_R * \rho)(P) = \sum_\sigma T_{R,\sigma} + S_R, \]
    %
    where
    %
    \[ T_\sigma = \int [R \widehat{m}(Rt)] \widehat{\rho}(t) L_{t,\sigma}\; dt, \]
    %
    and where
    %
    \[ S_R = \int [R \widehat{m}(Rt)] \widehat{\rho}(t) A_t\; dt. \]
    %
    We're analyze each of these terms separately.

    Firstly, $\{ S_R \}$ is a family of smoothing operators, uniformly in $R$. If
    %
    \[ b(x,y,\lambda) = \int \widehat{\rho}(t) A_t(x,y) e^{2 \pi i \lambda t}\; dt, \]
    %
    then integration by parts yields that
    %
    \[ |D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y b(x,y,\lambda)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,N} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
    The multiplication formula for the Fourier transform implies we can write
    %
    \[ S_R(x,y) = \int m_R(\lambda) b(x,y,\lambda)\; d\lambda. \]
    %
    This yields estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y S_R(x,y)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,N} \int \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N} \| m \|_{L^\infty_\lambda}\; d\lambda \lesssim \| m \|_{L^\infty_\lambda}. \]
    %
    Thus the operators $\{ S_R \}$ are smoothing, uniformly in $R$.

    Now we look at the operators $\{ T_\sigma \}$. Set
    %
    \begin{align*}
        c_{\sigma,R}(x,y,\tau) &= \int_0^\infty [R \widehat{m}(Rt)] \widehat{\rho}(t) a_\sigma(x,y,\tau,t) s_\sigma(\tau d_g(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i \tau \sigma_1 t}\; dt\\
        &= s_\sigma(\tau d_g(x,y)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty (m_R * \rho)(\sigma_1 \tau - \lambda) (\mathcal{F}_t a_\sigma)(x,y,\tau, \lambda)\; d\lambda.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Then
    %
    \[ T_\sigma = \int c_{\sigma,R}(x,y,\tau) e^{2 \pi i \sigma_2 \tau d_g(x,y)}\; d\tau. \]
    %
    This gives $T_\sigma$ as an oscillatory integral whose phase has canonical relation on the diagonal. If we can show that the family of functions $\{ c_{\sigma,R} \}$ are uniformly bounded in a given symbol class, then the equivalence of phase theorem implies we can write
    %
    \[ T_\sigma = \int \tilde{c}_{\sigma,R}(x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot (x - y)}\; d\xi, \]
    %
    where the symbols $\{ \tilde{c}_{\sigma,R}(x,y,\xi) \}$ are uniformly bounded, which proves what was required to be shown. To obtain these symbol bounds, we note that for any multi-indices $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\kappa$, the product rule and differentiation under convolution implies that $D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y D^\kappa_\tau c_{\sigma,R}(x,y,\tau)$ is a finite linear combination of terms of the form
    %
    \[ \tau^j R^{-\kappa_1} \phi_\circ(x,y) \cdot s_\circ(\tau d_g(x,y)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty (m_{\circ,R} * \rho_\circ)(\sigma_1 \tau - \lambda) (\mathcal{F}_t a_\circ)(x,y,\tau, \lambda)\; d\lambda, \]
    %
    where:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $s_\circ$ is a symbol of order $- (d-1)/2 - j - \kappa_0$.

        \item the functions $\phi_\circ$ and $\rho_\circ$ are smooth with $\text{supp}_\tau \rho_\circ \subset [-\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_0]$.

        \item $m_\circ$ is a symbol of order $-\kappa_1$, and $m_{\circ,R}(\lambda) = m_\circ(\lambda/R)$.

        \item $a_\circ$ is a symbol of order $d-\kappa_2$ in the $\tau$ variable, with $\text{supp}_\tau a_\circ \subset \text{supp}_\tau a_\sigma$.

        \item $\kappa_0 + \kappa_1 + \kappa_2 = \kappa$, and $0 \leq j \leq |\alpha| + |\beta|$.
    \end{itemize}

        Because $\text{supp}_t a_\sigma \subset I_{\text{max}}$, and
    %
    \[ |D^\alpha_t a_\circ(x,y,\tau,t)| \lesssim \tau^d, \]
    %
    we conclude that
    %
    \[ |(\mathcal{F}_t a_\sigma)(x,y,\tau, \lambda)| \lesssim_N \tau^d \lambda^{- N}. \]
    %
    Thus we conclude that
    %
    \[ \int_{|\lambda| \geq \varepsilon_0} (m_R * \rho_\circ)(\sigma_1 \tau - \lambda) (\mathcal{F}_t a_\circ)(x,y,\tau, \lambda)\; d\lambda \lesssim \| m \|_{L^\infty} \tau^d. \]
    %
    But if $|\lambda| \leq \varepsilon_0$,  then the fact that $m$ is a symbol of order zero, and because any $\tau \in \text{supp}_\tau a_\circ$ implies that
    %
    \[ |(m_R * \rho_\circ)(\sigma_1 \tau - \lambda)| \lesssim 1, \]
    %
    and so we also have that
    %
    \[ \int_{|\lambda| < \varepsilon_0} (m_R * \rho_\circ)(\sigma_1 \tau - \lambda) (\mathcal{F}_t a_\circ)(x,y,\tau,\lambda)\; d\lambda \lesssim 1 \lesssim \| m \|_{L^\infty} \tau^d \]
    %
    But this implies that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        &\left| \tau^i \phi_\circ(x,y) \cdot s_\circ(\tau d_g(x,y)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty (m_R * \rho_\circ)(\sigma_1 \tau - \lambda) (\mathcal{F}_t a_\circ)(x,y,\tau, \lambda)\; d\lambda \right|\\
        &\quad\quad \lesssim \tau^{i+d} \langle \tau d_g(x,y) \rangle^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - i} \lesssim \tau^{d - \frac{d-1}{2}} d_g(x,y)^{ - \frac{d-1}{2} - i}.
    \end{align*}

    But we also have
    %
    \[ |(m_R * \rho)(\tau)| \lesssim \| m \|_{L^\infty}, \]
    %
    which implies
    %
    \[ |c_{\sigma,R}(x,y,\tau)| \lesssim_N \| m \|_{L^\infty} \tau^{-N}. \]


    
    % Triangle Inequality Bounds
    % Sum over k, of the integral on the region t ~ 2^k / R for k = -inf to k = log R
    %   On the interval corresponding to k,

    %       rho^ has magnitude about 1

    For any multi-indices $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\kappa$, applying the product rule to the integral expression for $c_{\sigma,R}$ yields that the function $D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y D^\kappa_\tau c_{\sigma,R}$ is a finite sum of terms of the form
    %
    \[ \int [R \widehat{m}(Rt)] \widehat{\rho}(t) [t^{j + |\kappa|} \tilde{a}(x,y,\eta,t)] e^{2 \pi i t p(y,\eta)}\; dt \]

    Since
    %
    \[ |D^N m(\lambda)| \lesssim_N \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N} \]
    %
    \[ |D^N \lambda^M m(\lambda)| = \sum \lambda^{M-N+k} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-k} \]
    % lambda^{M-N} for lambda <= 1
    % lambda^{M-N} for lambda >= 1
    we find that for $N > M+1$,
    %
    \[ |D^M \widehat{m}(t)| \lesssim |t|^{-N} \]

    TODO: Switch back to other parametrix, it's better for this purpose.

    \[ c_{R,W}(x,y,\eta) = \int \widehat{\rho}(t) R \widehat{m}(Rt) a(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i t p(y,\eta)}\; dt. \]




    %

    %
    where $a_j$ is a symbol of order $j$, and where $- |\kappa| \leq j \leq |\alpha|$. Now if we set
    %
    \[ g_j(x,y,\eta,\lambda) = \int \widehat{\rho}(t) a_j(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i t[p(y,\eta) - \lambda]}\; dt, \]
    %
    then the multiplication formula for the Fourier transform yields that
    %
    \[ c_{R,W,j}(x,y,\eta) = (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} \int (D^{j + |\kappa|} m)(\lambda / R) g_j(x,y,\eta,\lambda)\; d\lambda. \]
    %
    Integration by parts yields that
    % Symbol of order 0 + |beta|
    \[ |g_j(x,y,\eta,\lambda)| \lesssim_M |\eta|^j \cdot \langle p(y,\eta) - \lambda \rangle^{-M}. \]
    %
    Since $P$ is elliptic, $|p(y,\eta)| \sim |\eta|$, and so we get that
    %
    \[ (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} \int_{|\lambda| \ll |p(y,\eta)|} (D^{j + |\kappa|} m)(\lambda / R) g_j(x,y,\eta,\lambda)\; d\lambda \lesssim_{j,M} |\eta|^{-M} \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} \int_{|\lambda| \gg |p(y,\eta)|} (D^{j + |\kappa|} m)(\lambda / R) g_j(x,y,\eta,\lambda)\; d\lambda \lesssim_{j,M} |\eta|^{-M}. \]
    %
    Finally, we get that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        & (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} \int_{|\lambda| \sim |p(y,\eta)|} (D^{j + |\kappa|} m)(\lambda / R) g_j(x,y,\eta,\lambda)\; d\lambda\\
        &\quad \lesssim (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} \left\langle \frac{|\eta|}{R} \right\rangle^{\mu - j - |\kappa|} |\eta|^j \int_{C^{-1} |p(y,\eta)|}^{C |p(y,\eta)|} \langle p(y,\eta) - \lambda \rangle^{-M}\; d\lambda\\
        &\quad \lesssim (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} \left\langle \frac{|\eta|}{R} \right\rangle^{\mu - j - |\kappa|} |\eta|^j.
    \end{align*}
    %
    For $|\eta| \leq R$, we thus get that
    %
    \[ |c_{R,W,j}(x,y,\eta)| \lesssim |\eta|^{-M} + (1/R)^{j + |\kappa|} |\eta|^j \lesssim |\eta|^{-M} + |\eta|^{-|\kappa|} \lesssim |\eta|^{-|\kappa|}. \]
    %
    For $|\eta| \geq R$, we get that
    %
    \[ |c_{R,W,j}(x,y,\eta)| \lesssim |\eta|^{-M} + R^{- \mu} |\eta|^{\mu - |\kappa|}. \]
    %
    Applying the equivalence of phase theorem, this proves the result if $\mu \geq 0$, but there are problems if $\mu < 0$.

\begin{lemma} \label{SmallTimeInequalityLemma}
    For all $f \in C^\infty(S^d)$,
    %
    \[ \| I_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}, \] 
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniformly bounded in $R \geq 1$ and $h$, for $1 < p < \infty$. Thus in particular,
    %
    \[ \| (Q_R \circ I_R \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $a$ be the inverse Fourier transform of the function $t \mapsto \chi_I(t) \widehat{h}(t)$. Then $I_R = a(P/R)$. If $\psi$ denotes the inverse Fourier transform of $\chi_I$, then we can write
    %
    \[ a(\lambda) = \int h(\alpha) \psi(\lambda - \alpha)\; d\alpha. \]
    %
    The fact that $h$ is a unit scale multiplier, and $\psi$ is Schwartz, implies that
    %
    \[ |\partial^\alpha a(\lambda)| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
    If we set $a_R(\lambda) = a(\lambda / R)$, then
    %
    \[ |\partial^\alpha a_R(\lambda)| \lesssim_\alpha \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-|\alpha|}, \]
    %
    with an implicit constant independent of $R$ for $R \geq 1$. Thus the family of symbols $\{ a_R : R \geq 1 \}$ form a uniformly bounded subset of the Fre\'{c}het space $\mathcal{S}^0(\RR)$ of order zero symbols, and so the operators $I_R$ are pseudodifferential operators of order zero, and uniformly bounded in the $L^p(S^d)$ norm for all $1 < p < \infty$, which yields the required claim.
\end{proof}

\section{Analysis of $III_R$}

We now show the uniform boundedness of the operators $\{ III_R \}$ on $L^p(S^d)$ in the range of $p$ we are considering in this problem, by a reduction to an endpoint local smoothing inequality. This might seem unintuitive, since the operators $III_R$ are obtained by averaging the wave equation over large times $|t| \gtrsim 1$, whereas local smoothing gives bounds for averages of the wave equation over times $|t| \lesssim 1$. We are able to reduce large times to small times by exploiting the \emph{periodicity} of the half-wave equation on the sphere.

\begin{lemma} \label{LocalSmoothingLargeTimesTheorem}
    Fix $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$, let $q$ be the H\"{o}lder conjugate to $p$, and let $I = [-1/2, 1/2]$. Suppose that the sharp local smoothing inequality
    %
    \[ \left\| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \right\|_{L^q(S^d) L^q_t(I)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^q_{\alpha_q-1/q}(S^d)} \]
    %
    holds for all $f \in C^\infty(S^d)$. Then the operators $\{ III_R \}$ satisfy a bound
    %
    \[ \| (III_R \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}, \]
    %
    with the implicit constant uniformly bounded in $R$. In particular,
    %
    \[ \| (Q_R \circ III_R \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}, \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    For each $R$, the \emph{class} of operators of the form $\{ III_R \}$ formed from a multiplier $h$ satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem \ref{MainSphereTheorem} is closed under taking adjoints. Indeed, if $III_R$ is obtained from $h$, then $III_R^*$ is obtained from the multiplier $\overline{h}$. Because of this self-adjointness, if we can prove that for any multiplier $h$ satisfying the assumptions of the theorem, the operators $\{ III_R \}$ are uniformly bounded in $L^q(S^d)$, where $q$ is the H\"{o}lder conjugate to $p$, then it follows by duality that for any such $h$, it is also true that the operators $\{ III_R \}$ are uniformly bounded back in the original $L^p(S^d)$ norm. In this argument we will prove such $L^q$ estimates, because we will exploit \emph{local smoothing} inequalities, which tend to work better with large Lebesgue exponents, precisely because Lebesgue norms with large exponents are more sensitive to functions with sharp peaks, something explicitly prevented by obtaining control over the smoothness of a function.

    We begin by noting that for a pair of H\"{o}lder conjugates $p$ and $q$, $\alpha_q = \alpha_p$. Using the periodicity of the wave equation on $S^d$, i.e. that
    %
    \[ e^{2 \pi i (t + n) P} = e^{2 \pi i t P} \quad\quad\quad\text{for $n \in \ZZ$ and $t \in \RR$}, \]
    %
    we can write
    %
    \[ III_R = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} H_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
    %
    where
    %
    \[ H_R(t) = \sum_l \chi_{III}(t) R \widehat{h}(R(t + l)) = \sum_l H_{R,l}(t). \]
    %
    Now
    %
    \begin{align*}
        &\left( \sum_{l \neq 0} \left( |Rl|^{\alpha_q} \| H_{R,l} \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} \right)^p \right)^{1/p}\\
        &\quad\quad \sim R \left( \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \sum_l \left( |R(t + l)|^{\alpha_q} |\widehat{h}(R(t + l))| \right)^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
        &\quad\quad\sim R \left( \int_{|t| \geq 1/2} \left( |Rt|^{\alpha_q} |\widehat{h}(Rt)| \right)^p\; dt \right)^{1/p} \\
        &\quad\quad\lesssim R^{1/q} C_p(h).
    \end{align*}
    %
    and
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| H_{R,0} \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} &= \left( \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} |\chi_{III}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt)|^p \right)^{1/p}\\
        &\leq \left( \int_{1/200 \leq |t| \leq 1/2} |R \widehat{h}(Rt)|^p \right)^{1/p}\\
        &= R^{1/q} \left( \int_{R/3}^{R/2} |\widehat{h}(t)|^p \right)^{1/p}\\
        &\lesssim R^{1/q - \alpha_q} C_p(h).
    \end{align*}
    %
    Since the family of functions $\{ H_{R,l} \}$ could in general be chosen arbitrarily, they can be quite correlated, and so we should expect H\"{o}lder's inequality should be efficient, in the worst case. Thus we conclude that, provided $p < 2d/(d+1)$, so that $q > 2d/(d-1)$, and thus
    %
    \[ q \alpha_q = (d-1)(q/2 - 1) > 1, \]
    %
    so we can use H\"{o}lder's inequality to conclude that
    % (d-1)(q/2 - 1) > 1
    % q > 2d/(d-1)
    \begin{align*}
        \| H_R \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} &\leq \sum_l \| H_{R,l} \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]}\\
        &= \| H_{R,0} \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} + \sum_{l \neq 0} \left( |Rl|^{\alpha_q} \| H_{R,l} \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} \right) |Rl|^{-\alpha_q} \\
        &\lesssim R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} C_p(h) + ( R^{1/q} C_p(h) ) \left( \sum_{l \neq 0} |Rl|^{- \alpha_q q} \right)^{1/q}\\
        &= R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} C_p(h) \left( 1 + \left( \sum_{l \neq 0} |l|^{-\alpha_q q} \right)^{1/q} \right)\\
        &= R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} C_p(h) \left( 1 + \left( \sum_{l \neq 0} |l|^{- \alpha_q q} \right)^{1/q} \right) \\
        &\lesssim_p R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} C_p(h).
    \end{align*}
    %
    A further application of H\"{o}lder's inequality shows that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        | III_R | &= \left| \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} H_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt \right|\\
        &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} \left( \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} |e^{2 \pi i P}|^{q}\; dt \right)^{1/q}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Applying the endpoint local smoothing inequality, we conclude that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| (III_R \circ Q_R)f \|_{L^{q}(M)} &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} \| e^{2 \pi i P} (Q_R f) \|_{L^{q}_t L^{q}_x}\\
        &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{-\alpha_q + 1/q} \| Q_R f \|_{L^{q}_{\alpha_q - 1/q}(M)},
    \end{align*}
    %
    Applying Bernstein's inequality gives
    %
    \[ \| Q_R f \|_{L^{q}_{\alpha_q - 1/q}(M)} \lesssim R^{\alpha_q - 1/q} \| f \|_{L^q(M)}. \]
    %
    Thus we conclude that
    %
    \[ \| (III_R \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^{q}(M)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^{q}(M)}. \]
    %
    We have therefore bounded $III_R$ uniformly in $R$.
\end{proof}

Corollary 1.2 of \cite{LeeSeeger} establishes that the sharp local smoothing inequality holds for $p < 2(d-1)/(d+1)$, which covers the range of parameters studied in this paper. Thus we have obtained uniform bounds on the operators $\{ III_R \}$.

\begin{comment}

As we have already made notice, for $f \in V_R$, $Q_R f = f$. Thus proving Theorem \ref{RestrictedMainSphereTheorem} is equivalent to proving bounds of the form
%
\begin{equation} \label{MainEquationWithQ}
    \| (M_R \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}
\end{equation}
%
for $f \in V_R$. If we combine Lemma \ref{LargeTimeQBounds} with Lemma \ref{SmoothInputBounds}, we conclude that
%
\[ \| (M_R \circ Q_R^{\text{High}}) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim_s R^s \| Q_R^{\text{High}} f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{s-N} \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}. \]
%
Taking $N \geq s$ yields
%
\begin{equation} \label{HighInequality}
    \| (M_R \circ Q_R^{\text{High}}) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}.
\end{equation}
%
Lemma \ref{LargeTimeQBounds} (for $N = 0$) and the bounds $\| Q_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}$ imply via the triangle inequality that
%
\begin{equation} \label{LowUniformBounds}
    \| Q_R^{\text{Low}} f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}.
\end{equation}
%
Combining \eqref{LowUniformBounds} with Lemmas \ref{SmallTimeInequalityLemma} and \ref{LocalSmoothingLargeTimesTheorem} also yields bounds of the form
%
\begin{equation} \label{HighInequality}
    \| (I_R \circ Q_R^{\text{Low}}) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \ \ \text{and}\ \ \| (III_R \circ Q_R^{\text{Low}}) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}.
\end{equation}
%
Combining \eqref{HighInequality} and \eqref{HighInequality}, we see that \eqref{MainEquationWithQ} will have been proved provided we can obtain a bound of the form
%
\begin{equation} \label{IIInequality}
    \| (II_R \circ Q_R^{\text{Low}}) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}.
\end{equation}
%
We will prove this inequality in the next section, which will complete the proof. notice that $II_R$ and $Q_R^{\text{Low}}$ are both defined only in terms of the wave propogators $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$ for $|t| \leq 1/100$, which will enable us to be able to use the Lax-H\"{o}rmander parametrix for the half-wave equation in order to obtain a more robust understanding of the operator.

\end{comment}

\begin{comment}

\section{Notation For the Parametrix}

We now recall the Lax parametrix construction, which we will make heavy use of in the sequel in the analysis of the operators $\{ II_R \}$. For $|t| \lesssim 1$, we can write
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t P} = T_{A,t} + \sum_{W \in \mathcal{W}} T_{W,t}, \]
%
where $T_{A,t}$ has kernel $A(t,\cdot,\cdot)$, and $T_{W,t}$ has kernel $W(t,\cdot,\cdot)$, with the following properties:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A \in C^\infty(\RR \times M \times M)$.

    \item For each $W \in \mathcal{W}$, we can find a compact set $K_0 \subset \RR^d$, contained in an open subset $\Omega$ of $\RR^d$, together with a diffeomorphism $G: \Omega \to S^d$, such that $W$ is supported on $G(X_0) \times \RR \times G(X_0)$.

    \item For $f \in C^\infty(M)$, and $x \in X$, we can write
    %
    \[ (T_W f)(G(x)) = \int_\Omega \int_{\RR^d} a(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i [ \varphi(x,y,\eta) + t p(y,\eta) ]} f(G(y))\; d\eta\; dy, \]
    %
    where:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The function $p$ is the principal symbol of the pseudodifferential operator $P$.

        \item The function $\varphi$ is smooth away from $\eta = 0$, homogeneous of degree one, and satisfies $\varphi(x,y,\eta) \approx (x - y) \cdot \eta$ in the sense that
        %
        \[ |\partial^\beta_\eta \{ \varphi(x,y,\eta) - (x - y) \cdot \eta \}| \lesssim_\beta |x - y|^2 |\eta|^{1 - \beta} \quad\text{for all $\beta$}. \]
        %
        We write $\phi(x,t,y,\eta) = \varphi(x,y,\eta) + t p(y,\eta)$.

        \item The amplitude function $a$ is a symbol of order zero with
        %
        \[ \text{supp}(a) \subset \{ (x,y,\eta,t) \in K_0 \times K_0 \times \RR^d \times \RR: |x - y| \lesssim 1\ \text{and}\ |\eta| \gtrsim 1 \}. \]
        %
        In particular, we may choose $\text{supp}_{x,y}(a)$ to be close enough to the diagonal so that one has
        %
        \[ |\nabla_\eta \varphi(x,y,\eta)| \gtrsim |x - y| \quad\text{and}\quad |\nabla_x \varphi(x,y,\eta)| \gtrsim |\eta| \]
        %
        for $(x,y) \in \text{supp}_{x,y}(a)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%
Thus, modulo smoothing operators, locally solutions to the half-wave equation have expressions as oscillatory integrals.


























We now recall the Hadamard parametrix construction, which we will make heavy use of in the sequel. We recall that on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$, the natural identification of $\DD(M)$ at a subset of $\DD(M)^*$ is given by applying the bilinear pairing
%
\[ (\phi, \psi) = \int \phi(x) \psi(x) dV_g(x). \]
%
Consider the function $s: \RR_t \times T^* M \to \RR$ given by
%
\[ s(t,\xi_x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\sin(2 \pi t |\xi|_g)}{|\xi|_g}. \]
%
Then the map $t \mapsto s(t,\cdot)$ is a smooth map from $\RR_t$ into $\mathcal{S}^1(T^* M)$. We can therefore defines a smooth map $t \mapsto E_+(t,\cdot)$ from $\RR_t$ into the family of all distributions of order $d$ on $M$ by considering the oscillatory integral distribution given by taking the weak limit of the
%
\[ \langle E_+(t,\cdot), \phi \rangle = H(t) \lim_{R \to \infty} \int \int \chi \left( \frac{|\xi|_g}{R} \right) \phi(x)  s(t,\xi_x) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi\; dx. \]


Here is the form of the parametrix we use here:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item There exists a sequence of smooth functions $\{ \alpha_k : k \geq 0 \}$, lying in $C^\infty(M \times M)$, and a series of distributions $\{ E_\nu : k \geq 0 \}$, lying in $\DD(M \times M)$, such that for any $N \geq 0$,
    %
    \[ \int (\partial_t^2 - \Delta_x) \left\{ \sum_{\nu \geq 0} a_\nu E_\nu \right\} = \delta(  ) \]
\end{itemize}


Normally, this parametrix is written, modulo elements of $C^\infty(M \times M)$, by a distribution $E(x,y,t)$ given by an integral in normal coordinates about the point $y$ by an equation of the form
%
\[ E(t,x,y) = \int_{T^*_y M} a(x,y, |\xi|_g ) e^{2 \pi i [ \xi \cdot (x - y) + t |\xi|_g ]}\; d\xi, \]
%
where $a$ is a classical symbol of order zero, which vanishes for $|\xi|_g \leq 100$. Note that because we are using normal coordinates, $|x - y| = d_g(x,y)$.
%by a $C^\infty(M \times M)$ linear combination of the distributions $E_k(x,y,t)$, given by testing against a function $u \in \DD(M \times M)$ by setting
%
%\[ \int \chi(\xi) \]
%\[ \int E_k(x,y,t) u(x,y)\; dy = \int_{T^* M} e^{2 \pi i [\xi \cdot (x - y) + t |\xi|_g]} |\xi|_g^{-k} u(x,y)\; d\xi\; dy. \]
%
Applying polar coordinates means we can write the distribution as
%
\[ \int_0^\infty a(x,y,\tau) B_d(\tau d_g(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i t \tau}\; d\tau, \]
%
where $a$ is now a classical symbol of order $d-1$ vanishing for $|\tau| \leq 1$.

Consider the distribution
%
\[ \int_0^\infty a(x,y,\tau) \chi(\tau d_g(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i t \tau}\; d\tau, \]
%
where $\chi$ is smooth and $\chi(\rho)$ vanishes for $|\rho| \geq 1$. Because $a$ vanishes for $|\tau| \leq 1$, the support of this distribution is thus contained in $\{ (x,y): d_g(x,y) \leq 1/100 \}$. Taking inverse Fourier transforms shows this quantity is also equal to
%
\[ d_g(x,y)^{-1} \int \widehat{a}(x,y, t - s ) \widehat{\chi} \left( \frac{s}{d_g(x,y)} \right)\; ds. \]
%
\[ 2^k  \int \eta( s ) \widehat{a}(x,y, t - d_g(x,y) 2^k s) \widehat{\chi}(2^k s)\; ds \]

Now
%
\[ \int_{T^* M} e^{2 \pi i [\xi \cdot (x - y) + t |\xi|_g]} |\xi|_g^{-k} = \int_M \int_0^\infty \rho^{d-1-k} B_d(\rho d_g(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i t \rho}\; d\rho. \]
%
These all differ, modulo $C^\infty(M \times M)$, from a distribution of the form
%
\[ \int_0^\infty \chi(\rho) \rho^{d-1-k} B_d(\rho d_g(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i t \rho} \; d\rho, \]
%
where $\text{supp}(\chi) \subset \{ |\rho| \geq 100 \}$, and equal to one on $\{ |\rho| \geq 2 \}$. Let us consider a distribution of the form
%
\[ \int_0^\infty \chi(\rho) \tilde{\chi}(\rho d_g(x,y)) \rho^{d-1-k} e^{2 \pi i t \rho}\; d\rho = \int_0^\infty \chi(\rho) \tilde{\chi}(\rho d_g(x,y)) \langle \rho \rangle^{d-1-k} e^{2 \pi i t \rho}\; d\rho, \]
%
where $\tilde{\chi}$ is compactly supported on $|\rho| \leq 1$, smooth, and equal to one on $|\rho| \leq 1/2$. In order for this quantity to be non-zero, we need $d_g(x,y) \leq 1 / 100$. This integral ranges over the region $[100, d_g(x,y)^{-1}]$. Let us understand this quantity via an integration by parts. The $N$th derivative of $\chi(\rho) \tilde{\chi}(\rho d_g(x,y) \langle \rho \rangle^{d-1-k}$ is a linear combination of terms of the form
%
\[ f_{N_1,N_2,N_3}(x,y,\rho) = D^{N_1} \chi(\rho) d_g(x,y)^{N_2} D^{N_2} \tilde{\chi}(\rho d_g(x,y)) \langle \rho \rangle^{d-1-k-N_3} \]
%
where $N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = N$. If $N_1 > 0$, then the term is supported on $1 \leq |\rho| \leq 2$, and we conclude that
%
\[ \| D^\alpha_x D^\beta_y f_{N_1,N_2,N_3} \|_{L^1_\rho} \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta} 1. \]
%
If $N_1 = 0$, but $N_2 > 0$, then the term is supported on $1 / 2 \leq \rho d_g(x,y) \leq 1$, and has magnitude $\lesssim d_g(x,y)^{N_2} d_g(x,y)^{N_3 + k + 1 - d}$, and so has $L^1$ norm $d_g(x,y)^{N + k - d}$. Finally, if $N_1 = N_2 = 0$, then the term has $L^1$ norm $O(1)$ if $N \geq k - d + 1$, and otherwise $d_g(x,y)^{N + k - d}$.

Then we can find a symbol $a$ of order $-d$, a smooth, rapidly decaying function $b$, and a symbol $c$ of order $k + 1$ such that the distribution is written as
%
\[ \int a(t - d_g(x,y) r - s) b(r) c(s)\; dr\; ds. \]


If $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the Fourier transforms of $\chi$ and $\tilde{\chi}$, and
%
\[ b(r,x,y) = \int b_1(r - d_g(x,y) s) b_2(s)\; ds \]


Then when $\chi(\rho d_g(x,y)) \neq 0$, $\chi(\rho) = 1$, so we can write the distribution as
%
\[ \int_0^\infty \chi(\rho d_g(x,y)) \rho^{d-1-k} e^{2 \pi i t \rho}\; d\rho, \]
%
which we can compute as
%
\[ d_g(x,y)^{k-d} \int_0^\infty \chi(\rho) \rho^{d-1-k} e^{2 \pi i (t / d_g(x,y)) \rho}\; d\rho. \]
% For k <= d-1
For $k \leq d-1$, this becomes a constant multiple of
%
\[ (D^{d-1-k} \widehat{\chi})( t / d_g(x,y) ). \]
%
For $k > d-1$,

% rho <= 1 / d_g(x,y)



%
\[ E_{j,k}(x,y) = \int_{T^*_y M} e^{2 \pi i [\xi \cdot x + t |\xi|_g]} |\xi|_g^{ - 1 - k}\; d\xi \]

%\begin{align*}
%    \int a(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x \pm it |\xi|}\; d\xi &= \int_0^\infty a(\rho) \rho^d B_d(\rho \cdot d_g(x,y)) e^{\pm 2 \pi i \rho t}\; d\rho.
%\end{align*}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $M$ be a compact manifold, and let $P$ be a classical, self-adjoint elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order one on $M$. Then there exists a time $T_{\text{max}} > 0$, such that for $t$ lying in the interval $I_{\text{max}} = [0, T_{\text{max}}]$, we can write
    %
    \[ \cos(2 \pi P t) = \sum_{\sigma \in \{ -, + \}^2 } L_{t,\sigma} + A_t, \]
    %
    where the right hand side is a sum of operators satisfying the following properties:

        of order $d$, with

        \[ \text{supp}_\tau \{ a_\sigma \} \subset \{ \tau \gtrsim 1 \}, \]
        %
        and a classical symbol
        %
        \[ s_\sigma: [0,\infty) \to \CC, \]
        %
        of order $- \frac{d-1}{2}$, such that
        %
        \[ L_{t,\sigma} f(x) = \int_0^\infty a_\sigma(x,y,t,\tau) s_\sigma(\tau d_g(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i \tau \phi_\sigma(t,d_g(x,y))} f(y)\; d\tau\; dy, \]
        %

        %
%        \[ L_{t,\kappa} f(G(x)) = \text{sgn}(t) \int E_\nu(|t|,d_g(x,y)) f(G(y))\; dy \]

\section{Analysis of $II_R$: Inner Product Estimates}

%Accounting for Lemmas \ref{SmallTimeInequalityLemma} and \ref{LocalSmoothingLargeTimesTheorem}, it

It finally remains to analyze the operator $Q_R \circ II_R \circ Q_R$, where
%
\[ II_R = \int \chi_{II}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt \] % \quad\text{and} \quad Q_R^{\text{Low}} = \int c_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
is obtained by integrating the wave propogators over times $100/R \leq |t| \leq 0.01$ respectively. To prevent notation from growing too cumbersome later on, let us eschew uses of the subscript $R$ in our operators in this section, e.g. writing $II_R$ as
%
\[ II = \int b(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
where $b(t) = \chi_{II}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt)$. We then have
%
\[ \| b(t) \langle t \rangle^{s_p} \|_{L^p(\RR)} \lesssim R^{1 - 1/p - s_p} C_p(h). \]
%
Bounding $II$ requires a more subtle analysis of the geometric behaviour of the wave-propogator operators, and we will begin by converting our problem in coordinates on $S^d$, where the kernels have more explicit representations in oscillatory integrals.
\begin{comment}

To prevent notation from growing too cumbersome later on, let us eschew uses of the subscript $R$ in our operators for now, e.g. writing the operator $II_R$ as
%
\[ II = \int b(t) e^{2 \pi i (t/R) P}\; dt. \]


It will be more natural to rescale this operator, writing
%
\[ II_R = \int b_R(t) e^{2 \pi i (t/R) P}\; dt \]
%
with
%
\[ b_R(t) = \chi_{II}(t / R) \widehat{h}(t) \]
%
supported on $|t| \leq R / 100$. Our assumptions on $h$ give that
%%
%We must prove bounds of the form
%
%\begin{equation} \label{IIRVRBound}
%    \| II_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \quad\text{for $f \in V_R$}.
%\end{equation}
%
%This will require a more detailed analysis than was required for the operators $\{ I_R \}$ and $\{ III_R \}$, involving computations of Fourier integrals in various coordinate systems. In this setting, it is difficult to directly exploit the fact that we are restricted our inputs to the space $V_R$. We therefore switch to an inequality equivalent to \eqref{IIRVRBound}, namely, that
%
%\begin{equation} \label{IIRBound}
%    \| (II_R \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \quad\text{for $f \in L^p(S^d)$}.
%\end{equation}
%
%This is because we can do more explicit computations with the operators $\{ Q_R \}$ and their kernels than we can with general elements of $V_R$.
To prevent notation from growing too cumbersome later on, let us eschew uses of the subscript $R$ in our operators for now, e.g. writing the operator $II_R$ as
%
\[ II = \int b(t) e^{2 \pi i (t/R) P}\; dt. \]
%
Essentially, we know the following facts about the function $b$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have $\| t^{s_p} b_R \|_{L^p(\RR)} \leq C_p(h)$.

    % b_R(t) = chi(t) R h^(Rt)
    % R^{-1} | <t>^{s_p} b_R(t/R) |_{L^p_t}
    % | b_{R,0} |_{L^p} << R^{1 - 1/p}
    \item We have
    %
    \[ \widehat{b}(\tau) = \int [R\widehat{\chi}_{II}(R \omega)] \cdot h \left( \tau - \omega \right)\; d\omega, \]
    %
    so the Fourier support of $b$ remains concentrated on $\{ |\tau| \sim 1 \}$, i.e. for $|\tau| \leq 1/4$ we have
    %
    \[ |\partial_\tau^\alpha \big\{ \widehat{b} \big\}(\tau)| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)}\; R^{-N}, \]
    %
    for $1/4 \leq |\tau| \leq 4$, we have
    %
    \[ \left| \partial_\tau^\alpha \big\{ \widehat{b} \big\}(\tau) \right| \lesssim \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)}, \]
    %
    and for $|\tau| \geq 4R$, we have
    %
    \[ \Big| \partial_\tau^\alpha \big\{ \widehat{b} \big\} (\tau) \Big| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)}\; \tau^{-N}. \]
    %
    Uncertainty principle heuristics thus imply that we should expect $b$ to be locally constant at a scale $\sim 1$. If we let $\mathcal{T}$ be all points in the lattice $\ZZ / 10$ lying in the set $\{ |t| \leq R / 99 \}$, and for each $t_0 \in \mathcal{T}$, write
    %
    \[ \chi_{II} = \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{T}} \chi_{t_0}, \]
    %
    where for each $t_0 \in \mathcal{T}$, $\chi_{t_0}$ is smooth and adapted to the sidelength $1$ interval centered at $t_0$, i.e. satisfying estimates of the form
    %
    \[ | (\partial_t^\alpha \chi_{t_0})(t) | \lesssim_\alpha 1. \]
    %
    We can thus decompose $b = \sum b_{t_0}$, where
    %
    \[ b_{t_0}(t) = \chi_{t_0}(t) b(t). \]
    %
    For such a decomposition, the functions $\{ b_{t_0} \}$ satisfy
    %
    \[ | \partial_\tau^\alpha \{ \widehat{b}_{t_0} \}(\tau) | \lesssim \| h \|_{L^\infty} \langle \tau \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
    Thus we should still think of $\widehat{b}_{t_0}$ as being Fourier localized to frequencies lying in the ball of radius $O(1)$ about the origin, though the localization has introduced non-negligible frequencies near the origin, which is to be expected given the heuristic constancy of the function $b$ at the scale we are localizing.

We will employ some restricted bounds, together with interpolation, to obtain $L^p$ estimates on the operators $Q \circ II \circ Q$. We thus introduce a set $E \subset S^d$ and try to obtain $L^{p,\infty}$ bounds on the function $S = (Q \circ II_W \circ Q) \{ E \}$. Given that $Q$ already acts, heuristically, by localizing the behaviour of it's inputs to the frequency $R$, despite the choice of the set $E$, the uncertainty principle implies $Q \{ E \}$ should be locally constant at a scale $1/R$, and so it is natural to discretize at this scale. Consider a maximal $1/2R$ separated subset $\mathcal{X}$ of $S^d$. Then break $E$ down into a disjoint union of sets $\{ E_{x_0}: x_0 \in \mathcal{X} \}$, where for $x_0 \in \mathcal{X}$, the set $E_{x_0}$ is supported on the geodesic ball of radius $1/R$ about $x_0$. Similarily, let $\mathcal{T}$ be all points in the lattice $\ZZ / 10 R$ lying in the set $\{ 100/R \leq |t| \leq 1 \}$, and write
%
\[ b = \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} u(t) b_t, \]
%
where for each $t \in \mathcal{T}$, $u(t) = \| b \|_{L^\infty[t - 10/R, t + 10/R]}$, and $b_t$ is a smooth function, compactly supported on the sidelength $1/R$ interval centered at $t$, satisfying
%
\[ |\partial^\alpha b_t| \lesssim_\alpha R^{|\alpha|}, \]
%
with implicit constants uniform in $b$ and $t$. By the Plancherel-Polya theorem\footnote{TODO: DO SUCH WEIGHTED VERSIONS EXIST?}, 
%
\[ \| u(t) \langle t \rangle^{s_p} \|_{l^p(\mathcal{T})} \lesssim R^{1 - s_p}. \]
%\[ \left( \sum_t \left( \| b_t \|_{L^p(\RR)} t^{s_p} \right)^p \right)^{1/p} \lesssim R^{-s_p} C_p(h). \]
%\[ \left( \sum_t \left( \left( |u_t| t^{s_p} \right)^p \right) \right)^{1/p} \lesssim R^{1/p-s_p} C_p(h) \]
%
%
% int | R h^(Rt)|^p <Rt>^{ps_p}
% |u_t|^p R^{-1} (Rt)^{ps_p} = int_{t' - 1/R}^{t' + 1/R} (Rt)^{ps_p} |R h^(Rt)|^p
% ( Sum ( |u_t| t^{s_p} )^p R^{(d-1)(1 - p/2) - 1} )^{1/p}
%
We can then write
%
\[ S = \sum |E_{x_0}| {S\!}_{x_0,t_0} \quad\text{where}\quad {S\!}_{x_0,t_0} = \int |E_{x_0}|^{-1} b_{t_0}(t) (Q \circ e^{2 \pi i t P} \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \}\; dt. \]
%
%For simplicity, let us assume that if
%
%\[ \mathcal{X}_0 = \{ x_0: E_{x_0} \neq \emptyset \}, \]
%
%then $|E_{x_0}| \sim 2^{-l} R^{-d}$ for all $x_0 \in \mathcal{X}_0$. 
Our computation would be complete if we could show that for any coefficients $\{ c(x_0,t_0) : x_0 \in \mathcal{X}, t_0 \in \mathcal{T} \}$,
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{x_0,t_0} c(x_0,t_0) t_0^{\frac{d-1}{2}} {S\!}_{x_0,t_0} \right\|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim R^{s_p - 1 + d(1 - 1/p)} \left( \sum_{x_0,t_0} |c(x_0,t_0)|^p t_0^{d-1} \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
Indeed, we set $c(x_0,t_0) = |E_{x_0}| u(t_0) t_0^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}$ and apply H\"{o}lder's inequality, then the inequality above gives exactly that
% R^{1 - s_p}
\[ \| S \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) |E|^{1/p}, \]
%
and thus we obtain a restricted strong type inequality in $L^p(S^d)$. In order to prove this, since we can apply interpolation, we can restrict $c$ to be the indicator function of a set $\mathcal{E}$. If we write $\mathcal{E} = \bigcup_k \mathcal{E}_k$, where $\mathcal{E}_k$ is the set of $(x,t) \in \mathcal{E}$ with $|t| \sim 2^k / R$, then the inequality reads that
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k} {S\!}_{x_0,t_0} \right\|_{L^p(S^d)}^p \lesssim R^{(d-1)p - d} \left( \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k \right) \]%
Our first goal will be to understand how orthogonal the functions $\{ {S\!}_{x_0,t_0} \}$ are to one another, which will give $L^2$ estimates for $S$, that can be interpolated with $L^1$ estimates to obtain the required $L^p$ estimates. The rest of this section will be devoted to proving the following inner product estimate, which, together with a density decomposition argument, introduced in \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger}, can be used to obtain $L^2$ estimates, which we can then interpolate to obtain $L^p$ estimates for the function $S$.

\begin{lemma} \label{mainOrthogonalityLemma}
    %
    \[ \left| \langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle \right| \lesssim_M \frac{R^{d-2}}{( R d_g(x_0,x_1) )^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \sum_{\pm} \Big\langle R \big| (t_0 - t_1) \pm d_g(x_1,x_0) \big| \Big\rangle^{-M}. \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{comment}

We now employ the \emph{Lax Parametrix} construction, writing, for $|t| \leq 0.01$,
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t P} = W(t) + A(t). \]
%
Here $A(t)$ is a Schwartz operator, whose kernel $A(t,x,y)$ is a smooth function of $t$, $x$, and $y$, and $W(t)$ is a Schwartz operator, with kernel satisfying
%
\[ \text{supp}(W) \subset \{ (t,x,y) : d(x,y) \leq t + 0.01 \}, \]
%
and such that, if we consider Schwartz operators $\{ W_\alpha(t) \}$ with kernel
%
\[ W_\alpha(t,x,y) = \tilde{\eta}_\alpha(x) W(t,x,y) \tilde{\eta}_\alpha(y), \]
%
then $W(t) = \sum W_\alpha(t)$, and each operator $W_\alpha(t)$ can, in the coordinate system $U_\alpha$, be given as a Fourier integral with canonical relation supported in the geodesic light cone, i.e. for each $\alpha$, there exists a symbol $s$ of order zero, and a phase function $\Phi$ such that the pushforward operator $W_\alpha^{z_\alpha}(t)$ has kernel
%
\[ W_\alpha^{z_\alpha}(t,x,y) = \int s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi, \]
%
where $\Phi(t,x,y,\xi) = \phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi_y|_g$, and where $\exp$ denotes the geodesic flow in cotangent space. Let us use this decomposition to write $II = II_W + II_A$, where
%
\[ II_W = \int b(t) W(t)\; dt \quad\text{and}\quad II_A = \int b(t) A(t)\; dt. \]
%
%Similarily, we can write the operator $Q^{\text{Low}}$ as $Q^{\text{Low}}_W + Q^{\text{Low}}_A$, where
%
%\[ Q^{\text{Low}}_W = \int c(t) W(t)\; dt \quad\text{and}\quad Q^{\text{Low}}_A = \int c(t) A(t)\; dt. \]
%
The kernel of $II_A$ is non-singular, which makes it simple to deal with.

\begin{lemma} \label{IIALemma}
    Fix $1 \leq p \leq 2d/(d+1)$. Then for any $1 \leq q \leq \infty$,
    %
    \[ \| II_A f \|_{L^q(M)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^q(M)} \quad\text{for $f \in C^\infty(M)$,} \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniform in $R$. From the uniform boundedness of $\{ Q_R \}$, it immediately follows that
    %
    \[ \| (II_A \circ Q_R) f \|_{L^q(M)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^q(M)}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $K$ denote the kernel of $II_A$, i.e. so we have
    %
    \[ K(x,y) = \int b(t) A(t,x,y)\; dt. \]
    %
    Then H\"{o}lder's inequality, combined with the fact that $b$ is supported on the interval $I = \{ 50/R \leq |t| \leq 2/5 \}$ implies that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| K \|_{L^\infty_x(S^d) L^\infty_y(S^d)} &\lesssim \| b (R t)^{s_p} \|_{L^p_t(I)} \| A \cdot (R t)^{-s_p} \|_{L^{p^*}_t(I)}\\
        &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{1/p^* - s_p}\\
        &\lesssim C_p(h),
    \end{align*}
    %
    where we used the fact that $1/p^* - s_p < 0$ for $1 \leq p < 2d/(d+1)$, i.e. the range of the radial multiplier conjecture. But since $S^d$ has finite measure, we can now apply Schur's Lemma to conclude that $II_A$ is bounded from $L^1(M)$ to $L^1(M)$ and $L^\infty(M)$ to $L^\infty(M)$, with an operator norm bounded by a constant multiple of $C_p(h)$. Interpolation completes the proof.
\end{proof}

%The bounds $\| Q f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}$ and $\| Q^{\text{High}} f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}$ imply that $\| Q^{\text{Low}} f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}$, and so we conclude that
%%\[ \| (II_A \circ Q^{\text{Low}}) f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}. \]
%
%The next lemma gives a bound on $II_W \circ Q^{\text{Low}}_A$, so that we have reduced ourselves to the study of $II_W \circ Q^{\text{Low}}_W$.

\begin{lemma}
    We have
    %
    \[ \| (II_W \circ Q^{\text{Low}}_A) f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniform in $R$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The smoothness of $A$ implies that the function
    %
    \[ Z(t,s,x,y) = \iint W(t,x,z) A(s,z,y)\; dz \]
    %
    is smooth (a distribution applied to a smooth function is smooth). We can then write the kernel of $II_W \circ Q^{\text{Low}}_A$ as
    %
    \[ K(x,y) = \iint b(t) c(s) Z(t,s,x,y)\; dt\; ds. \]
    %
    As in Lemma \ref{IIALemma}, applying H\"{o}lder's inequality to separate out the $b$ variable from the other variables gives that for $1 \leq p < 2d/(d+1)$,
    %
    \[ \| K \|_{L^\infty_x(S^d) L^\infty_y(S^d)} \lesssim C_p(h) R^{1/p^* - s_p} \lesssim C_p(h), \]
    %
    and we can again apply Schur's Lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
It is natural to break this operator over dyadic multiples of $1/R$. Thus we write
%
\[ II = \sum_{1 \lesssim k \lesssim R} II_k, \]
%
where
%
\[ II_k = \int b_k(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
where $b_k(t) = \chi_{II,k}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt)$. Thus $\text{supp} \{ a_k \} \subset \{ |t| \sim R / 2^k \}$, and
%
\[ \sum_k 2^{ks_p} \| b_k \|_{L^p(\RR)} \lesssim C_p(h) R^{1 - 1/p}. \]
% chi( R t / 2^k ) R h^(Rt)
% Derivative
More generally, we have
%
\[ \sum_k 2^{ks_p} \| \partial^\alpha b_k \|_{L^p(\RR)} \lesssim C_p(h) R^{|\alpha| + 1 - 1/p}, \]
%
which reflects the uncertainty principle based heuristic that since $h$ is supported on frequencies $\lesssim 1$, it's Fourier transform is locally constant at a scale $1$, and thus the functions $b_k$ are locally constant at a scale $1/R$.
\end{comment}

Let us proceed with the proof. To begin with, we can use the self-adjointness of the operators $Q$, the semigroup structure of $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$, and the fact that multipliers commute, to write
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle &= \int \frac{b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b_{t_1}(s)}}{|E_{x_0}| |E_{x_1}|}\; \Big\langle (Q \circ e^{2 \pi i t P} \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \}, (Q \circ e^{2 \pi i s P} \circ Q) \{ E_{x_1} \} \Big\rangle\; dt\; ds\\
    &= \int \frac{b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b_{t_1}(s)}}{|E_{x_0}| |E_{x_1}|}\; \Big\langle (Q^2 \circ e^{2 \pi i (t - s) P} \circ Q^2) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \Big\rangle\\
    &= \int \frac{c_{t_0,t_1}(t)}{|E_{x_0}||E_{x_1}|} \Big\langle (Q^2 \circ e^{2 \pi i t P} \circ Q^2) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \Big\rangle,
\end{align*}
%
\begin{comment}

The wave propogators $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$ form a unitary semigroup. As a result, the Lax parametrix $\{ W(t) \}$ also satisfy the semigroup property \emph{modulo smoothing operators}, i.e. there exists a Schwartz operator $B(t,s)$ whose kernel $B(t,s,x,y)$ is smooth, such that
%
\[ W(s)^* \circ W(t) = W(t - s) + B(t,s). \]
%
This smoothness implies that
%
\[ \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda \{ B(t,s,\cdot,y) \} \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} \lesssim_N \lambda^{-N}, \]
%
and this together with the Weyl Law and the triangle inequality is sufficient to conclude that the kernel $K(t,s,x,y)$ of $Q \circ B(t,s)$ satisfies bounds of the form
%
\[ |K(t,s,x,y)| = \left| \sum \beta(\lambda / R) \mathcal{P}_\lambda \{ B(t,s,\cdot,y) \} \right| \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \]
%
Schur's Lemma, applied to $Q \circ B(t,s)$, together with the uniform boundedness of $Q$, implies that
%
\[ \| (Q \circ B(t,s) \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \} \|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} |E_{x_0}|^{1/2} \]
%
and so Cauchy-Schwartz implies that
%
\begin{align*}
    &\left| \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b_{t_1}(s)} \langle (Q \circ B(t,s) \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; ds \right|\\
    &\quad \lesssim_N R^{-N} \int |b_{t_0}(t)| |b_{t_1}(s)| |E_{x_0}|^{1/2} |E_{x_1}|^{1/2}\; dt\; ds\\
    &\quad\lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}.
\end{align*}

\end{comment}
%
where
%
\[ c_{t_0,t_1}(t) = \int b_{t_0}(u) \overline{b_{t_1}}(u - t)\; dt, \]
%
is the convolution of $b_{t_0}$ with the reflection of $\overline{b_{t_1}}$ about the $y$-axis. Thus $c_{t_0,t_1}$ is supported on the length $2/R$ interval centered at $t_0 - t_1$, and has $L^1$ norm $O(1/R^2)$ by Young's convolution inequality.

We next perform a decomposition of the inner product into various coordinate systems. Cover $S^d$ by a finite family of sets $\{ V_\alpha \}$, chosen such that for each $V_\alpha$, there is a coordinate chart $U_\alpha$ such that the neighbourhood $N(V_\alpha, 0.5)$ is contained in $U_\alpha$. Let $\{ \eta_\alpha \}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to $\{ V_\alpha \}$. It will also be convenient to define $V_\alpha^* = N(V_\alpha, 0.1)$. We can then write
%
\[ \langle S_{t_0,x_0}, S_{t_1,x_1} \rangle = \sum_\alpha \int \frac{c_{t_0,t_1}(t)}{|E_{x_0}||E_{x_1}|} \big\langle (Q^2 \circ e^{2 \pi i t P} \circ Q^2) \{ \eta_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_0} \big\rangle\; dt. \]
%
We will bound each of the terms on the right separately from one another, by working with each inner product in the coordinate systems $\{ U_\alpha \}$.

The next Lemma allows us to approximate the operator $Q$, and the propogators $e^{2 \pi i t P}$, with operators which have more explicit representations in the coordinate system $U_\alpha$, by an error term which is negligible to our analysis. It utilizes the \emph{Lax-H\"{o}rmander parametric} for the half-wave equation over small times, which expresses $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ in coordinates as a Fourier integral operator.

%The next Lemma allows us to replace $Q$ with an operator more amenable to analysis in the coordinate systems $\{ U_\alpha \}$. Similar proofs are given as Lemma 2.4 of (TODO: Sogge, Seeger, 1989), or (TODO: Find Taylor reference), or (TODO: Sogge).

\begin{lemma} \label{pseudodifferentialCoordinateLemma}
    For each $\alpha$, and $|t| \leq 1/100$, there exists Schwartz operators $Q_\alpha$ and $W_\alpha(t)$, each with kernel supported on $U_\alpha \times V^*_\alpha$, such that the following properties hold:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $f \in C^\infty(S^d)$ with $\text{supp}(f) \subset V^*_\alpha$,
        %
        \[ \text{supp}(Q_\alpha f) \subset N(\text{supp}(f), 0.1) \quad\text{and}\quad \text{supp}(W_\alpha(t) f) \subset N(\text{supp}(f), 0.1). \]
        %
        Moreover,
        %
        \[ \| (Q^2 - Q_\alpha) f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \]
        %
        and
        %
        \[ \bigg\| \Big(Q_\alpha \circ \Big( e^{2 \pi i t P} - W_\alpha(t) \Big) \circ Q_\alpha \Big) \{ f \} \bigg\|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)}. \]

        \item In the coordinate system of $U_\alpha$, $Q_\alpha$ is a pseudodifferential operator of order zero given by a symbol $\sigma(x,\xi)$, where
        %
        \[ \text{supp}(\sigma) \subset \{ |\xi| \sim R \}, \]
        %
        and $\sigma$ satisfies derivative estimates of the form
        %
        \[ |\partial^\beta_x \partial^\kappa_\xi \sigma(x,\xi)| \lesssim_{\beta,\kappa} R^{-|\kappa|}. \]

        \item In the coordinate system $U_\alpha$, the operator $W_\alpha(t)$ has a kernel $W_\alpha(t,x,y)$ with an oscillatory integral representation
        %
        \[ W_\alpha(t,x,y) = \int s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi|_y ]}\; d\xi, \]
        %
        where $s$ has compact support in it's $x$ and $y$ coordinates, with
        %
        \[ \text{supp}(s) \subset \{ |\xi| \sim R \}, \]
        %
        where $s$ satisfies derivative estimates of the form
        %
        \[ | \partial_{t,x,y}^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa s | \lesssim_{\beta, \kappa} R^{- |\kappa|}, \]
        %
        and where $| \cdot |_y$ denotes the norm on $\RR^n_\xi$ induced by the Riemannian metric on $S^d$ on the contangent space $T^*_y S^d$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{comment}

\begin{proof}
    Introduce some $\rho \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ with compact support near the origin, and use the Lax parametrix to write
    %
    \begin{align*}
        Q &= \int R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt\\
        &= \int \rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt + \int (1 - \rho(t)) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt\\
        &= \int \rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) W(t) + \int \rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) A(t)\\
        &\quad\quad + \int (1 - \rho(t)) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Write these three terms as $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$. We can write $T_3 = r(P)$, where $r$ is the inverse Fourier transform of $(1 - \rho(t)) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt)$. The rapid decay of $\widehat{\beta}$ implies that
    %
    \[ |(\partial_\lambda^\alpha r)(\lambda)| \lesssim_{\alpha,N} R^{-N} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-M} \quad\text{for all $N,M \geq 0$}, \]
    %
    and so the Weyl Law and Schur's Lemma implies that
    %
    \[ \| T_3 f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)}. \]
    %
    Since the kernel of $A$ is smooth, if $\psi(\lambda,x,y)$ denotes the Fourier transform of $\rho(t) A(t,x,y)$ in the $t$-variable, then $|\psi(\lambda,x,y)| \lesssim_N \langle \lambda \rangle^{-N}$, and so the multiplication formula implies that
    %
    \[ \left| \int \rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) A(t, x, y)\; dt \right| = \left| \int \beta(\lambda/R) \psi(t,x,y)\; dt \right| \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \]
    %
    We can now again apply Schur's Lemma to conclude that
    %
    \[ \| T_2 f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \quad\text{for $f \in C^\infty(S^d)$}. \]
    %
    Next, we note that for $f \in C^\infty_c(\tilde{V}_\alpha)$. We now abuse notation, working in coordinates, and identifying an operator with it's pushforward in the coordinate system $z_\alpha$. Since $W(t) f = W_\alpha(t) f$, the operator $T_1$ has a kernel representation
    %
    \begin{align*}
        T_1(x,y) &= \int \rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) W(t,x,y)\; dt\\
        &= \int \int \rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi_y|_g]}\; d\xi,
    \end{align*}
    %
    where $s$ is supported on $\{ d_g(x,y) \leq 0.01 \}$. If we let $\tilde{s}(\lambda,x,y,\xi)$ denote the inverse Fourier transform of $\rho(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt) a(t,x,y,\xi)$ in the $t$ variable, then we can write
    %
    \[ T_1(x,y) = \int \tilde{s}(|\xi_y|_g,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
    %
    If we write $\tilde{s} = s_1 + s_2$, where
    %
    \begin{align*}
        & s_1(\lambda,x,y,\xi) = \chi(\lambda/R) \tilde{s}(\lambda,x,y,\xi)\\
        &\quad\quad\quad\text{and}\quad s_2(\lambda,x,y,\xi) = (1 - \chi(\lambda/R)) \tilde{s}(\lambda,x,y,\xi),
    \end{align*}
    %
    where $\chi$ has support on the band $\{ |\lambda| \sim_\alpha 1 \}$, and is equal to one on a slightly thinner band, then
    % beta_R * psi
    % D^s (beta_R * psi)
    % = R^{-N} ((D^s beta_R) * psi)
    % R^{-M} lambda^{-M}
    % For 
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa \partial_\lambda^\gamma s_1)(\lambda,x,y,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,\kappa,\gamma} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-\gamma} \langle \xi \rangle^{-\kappa}, \]
    %
    and
    %
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa \partial_\lambda^\gamma s_2)(\lambda,x,y,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,\kappa,\gamma,N,M} R^{-N} \langle \lambda \rangle^{-M} |\xi|^{-\kappa}. \]
    %
    Write $T_1 = S_1 + S_2$, where for $j \in \{ 1, 2 \}$, the operator $S_j$ has kernel
    %
    \[ S_j(x,y) = \int s_j(|\xi_y|_g, x,y, \xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
    %
    Write $\tilde{s}_j(x,y,\xi) = s_j(|\xi_y|_g, x, y, \xi)$. Then
    %
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa) \{ \tilde{s}_2 \}(x,y,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha, \beta, \kappa, N} R^{-N} |\xi|^{-\kappa}. \]
    %
    Applying the theory of pseudodifferential operators of order zero, we conclude that
    %
    \[ \left\| S_2 f \right\|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} \| f \|_{L^2(S^d)} \quad\text{for all $f \in C_c^\infty(\tilde{V}_\alpha)$}. \]
    %
    On the other hand, we have
    %
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa) \{ \tilde{s}_1 \}(x,y,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,\kappa} |\xi|^{-\kappa}. \]
    %
    The theory of pseudodifferential operators thus implies that $S_1$ is a pseudodifferential operator of order zero, and, because the above estimates are uniform in $R$, the symbol $\mathfrak{s}(x,\xi)$ of $S_1$ satisfies estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa \mathfrak{s})(x,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,\kappa} |\xi|^{-\kappa} \]
    %
    uniformly in $R$. We can also calculate the symbol via the oscillatory integral formula
    %
    \[ \mathfrak{s}(x,\xi) = \int \tilde{s}_1(x,y,\eta) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\eta) + \xi \cdot (y - x)]}\; d\eta\; dy. \]
    %
    Using the fact that $|\eta| \sim R$ on the support of $\tilde{s}_1$, unless $|\xi| \sim R$, the integral will be non-stationary in the $y$-variable, and we can use this to show that for such values of $\xi$,
    %
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_\xi^\beta \mathfrak{s})(x,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta, N,M} R^{-N} |\xi|^{-M}. \]
    %
    We thus see that setting $Q_\alpha$ to be the pseudodifferential operator with symbol $\tilde{\chi}(\xi / R) \mathfrak{s}(x,\xi)$ completes the proof, where $\tilde{\chi}$ is smooth, compactly supported on $\{ |\xi| \sim R \}$, and equal to one on a slightly narrower band.

%\begin{proof}
%    The standard Lax-Parametrix construction (see TODO) implies that for each $\alpha$, we can find operators $\tilde{W}_t$ and $\tilde{A}_t$ such that for $x \in U_\alpha$ and $y \in V_\alpha^*$,
    %
%    \[ e^{2 \pi i t P}(x,y) = \tilde{W}_t(x,y) + \tilde{A}(t,x,y), \]

%        \[ |\partial_{t,x,y}^\beta \partial_\xi^\kappa \tilde{s}| \lesssim_{\beta,\kappa} R^{- |\kappa|}. \]
%    \end{itemize}
    %
%    In other words, $\tilde{W}_t$ satisfies all our required assumptions, except that $\tilde{s}$ is not supported on $\{ |\xi| \sim R \}$. But we define $s(t,x,y,\xi) = \tilde{s}(t,x,y,\xi) \chi( \xi / R )$ for some fixed $\chi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$.

%    and such that $\tilde{A}(t,x,y)$ is a $C^\infty$ function in the $x$ and $y$ variables.


%    Lemma TODO implies

%    \[ \left| \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) \big\langle (Q \circ e^{2 \pi i t P} \circ (Q - Q_\alpha)) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle\; du \right| \lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}. \]

%    The smoothness of the kernel of $A(t)$ implies that

%    \[ \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda \{ A(t, \cdot, y) \} \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} \lesssim_N \lambda^{-N}, \]
    %
%    and this together with the Weyl Law and the triangle inequality is sufficient to argue that the kernel of $Q \circ A(u)$ has $L^\infty$ norm $O_N(R^{-N})$ for all $N > 0$. Using Schur's Lemma, we conclude that (TODO: DETAILS)
    %
%    \[ \left| \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) \big\langle (Q \circ A(t) \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle\; du \right| \lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}, \]
    %
%    another negligible error. Finally, using Lemma \ref{pseudodifferentialCoordinateLemma} again, we have
    %
%    \[ \left| \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) \big\langle (Q - Q_\alpha) \circ W_t \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle\; du \right| \lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}. \]
    %
%    TODO: THE REST.

%    Fix a large constant $C > 0$, and consider a function $\chi \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ equal to one on $\{ C^{-1} \leq |\xi| \leq C \}$. Consider
    %
%    \[ \tilde{W}(t) = \int \chi(\xi/R) s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(t,y,\xi) + x \cdot \xi ]}\; d\xi. \]
    %
%    We first claim that $(Q_\alpha \circ (W_t - \tilde{W}(t))(x,y)$ has $L^\infty$ norm $O_N(R^{-N})$. Indeed, we can write this integral as
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        &\int \sigma(x,\theta) (1 - \chi(\xi / R)) s(t,w,y,\xi)\\
%        &\quad\quad\quad\quad e^{2 \pi i [ \theta \cdot (x - w) + w \cdot \xi - \phi(t,y,\xi) ]}\; dw\; d\xi\; d\theta.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    Notice that
    %
%    \[ \nabla_w \{ \theta \cdot (x - w) + w \cdot \xi - \phi(t,y,\xi) \} = \theta - \xi. \]
    %
%    On the support of the integral above, we have $|\theta| \sim R$, and we also either have $|\xi| \leq C^{-1} R$ or $|\xi| \geq C R$. In the former case, if $C$ is sufficiently large, we have
    %
%    \[ |\theta - \xi| \geq |\theta| - |\xi| \gtrsim R, \]
    %
%    and in the latter case,
    %
%    \[ |\theta - \xi| \geq |\xi| - |\theta| \gtrsim |\xi|. \]
    %
%    In either case, first integrating by parts arbitrarily many times in the $w$ variable, and then taking in absolute values and integrating in all variables yields the required result.
%\end{proof}

Thus, ignoring errors negligible to our analysis, we need only analyze
%
\[ \left| \int \frac{c_{t_0,t_1}(t)}{|E_{x_0}| |E_{x_1}|}\; \big\langle (Q_\alpha \circ W_\alpha(t) \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle\; du \right|. \]
%
The behaviour of all operations in this expression are now completely localized to $U_\alpha$ for inputs supported on $V^*_\alpha$; in particular, this expression is equal to zero unless $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$ are both compactly contained in $U_\alpha$, So we can now naturally work with the kernels of the operators in coordinates to upper bound the inner product, which will complete the required estimate of the inner product.

%\begin{lemma}
%    Modulo errors of order $O_N(R^{-N})$, the adjoint operator $Q_\alpha^*$ agrees with the pseudodifferential oeprator $Q_\alpha'$ with symbol $\sigma^*(x,\xi)$, supported on $\{ |\xi| \sim R \}$ and with uniform derivative bounds.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%    The symbol of the operator $Q_\alpha^*$ can be computed by the formula
    %
%    \[ (x,\xi) \mapsto \int \sigma(y,\eta) e^{2 \pi i (\xi + \eta) \cdot (y - x)}\; d\eta\; dy. \]
    %
%    If $|\xi| \leq R$, we may integrate by parts in the $y$ variable arbitrarily many times to conclude this integral is $O_N(R^{-N})$. If $|\xi| \gtrsim R$, we may integrate by parts in the $y$-variable arbitrarily many times to conclude this integral is $O_N(|\xi|^{-N})$. TODO: Clean this up.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $c$ be an integrable function supported on the length $10/R$ interval centered at a value $t^*$ with $|t| \leq 1/100$. Then

    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
%    Note that $\phi$ satisfies the Eikonal equation
    %
%    \[ |\nabla_w \phi(w,y,\xi)|_w = |\xi|_y, \]
    %
 %   and so $|\nabla_w \phi(w,y,\xi)| \sim |\xi|$.
% On the support of the integral above, we have $|\theta| \sim R$, and we also either have $|\xi| \leq C^{-1} R$ or $|\xi| \geq C R$. In the former case, if $C$ is sufficiently large, we have
    %
 %   \[ |\nabla_w \{ \theta \cdot (x - w) + \phi(w,y,\xi) + t |\xi|_y \}| \geq |\theta| - |\nabla_w \phi(w,y,\xi)| \gtrsim R, \]
    %
  %  and in the latter,
    %
   % \[ |\nabla_w \{ \theta \cdot (x - w) + \phi(w,y,\xi) + t |\xi|_y \}| \geq |\nabla_w \phi(w,y,\xi)| - |\theta| \gtrsim |\xi|. \]
    %
    %In either case, first integrating by parts arbitrarily many times in the $w$ variable, and then taking in absolute values and integrating in all variables yields the required result.
    We write the integral as
    %
    \begin{align*}
        & \int \frac{c(t)}{|E_{x_0}| |E_{x_1}|} (\eta_\alpha E_{x_1})(w)  \sigma(w,\theta) e^{2 \pi i \theta \cdot (w - x)}\\
        &\quad\quad\quad s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi|_y ]} \sigma(y,\eta) e^{2 \pi i \eta \cdot (y - z)} E_{x_0}(z)\\
        &\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \; dt\; dx\; dy\; dz\; dw\; d\theta\; d\xi\; d\eta.
    \end{align*}
    %
    The integral looks complicated, but can be simplified considerably by noticing that all the spatial variables are highly localized. To begin with, we use the fact that $s$ is smooth and compactly supported in all it's variables, so $s$ should roughly behave like a linear combination of tensor products; using Fourier series, we can write
    %
    \[ s(t,x,y,\xi) = \sum_{n \in \ZZ^d} s_{n,1}(x) s_{n,2}(t,y,\xi), \]
    %
    where $s_{n,1}(x) = e^{2 \pi i n \cdot x}$, and where
    %
    \[ |\partial_{t,y}^\alpha \partial_\xi^\kappa \{ s_{n,2} \}| \lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa,N} |n|^{-N} R^{- |\kappa|} \]
    %
    If we define $a_n(\xi) = a_{n,1}(R \xi) a_{n,2}(R \xi)$, where
    %
    \begin{align*}
        a_{n,1}(\xi) &= |E_{x_1}|^{-1} \int (\eta_\alpha E_{x_1})(w) \sigma(w,\theta) s_{n,1}(x) e^{2 \pi i [\theta \cdot (w - x) + (x - x_1) \cdot \xi ]}\; d\theta\; dw\; dx \intertext{\text{and}}
        a_{n,2}(\xi) &= |E_{x_0}|^{-1} \int c(t) s_{n,2}(t,y,\xi) \sigma(y,\zeta) E_{x_0}(z) e^{2 \pi i [ (\phi(t^*, x_0, \xi) - \phi(t,y,\xi)) + \zeta \cdot (y - z)]}\; d\zeta\; dt\; dy\; dz,
    \end{align*}
    %
    % a_{n,1}(xi) = int e(x) s_{n,1}(x) e^{2 \pi i (x - x_1) * xi}
    %       Here e has L^1 norm 1, and should decay
    %       rapidly away from a 1/R neighborhood of x_1
    %       So this a_{n,1} should have L^infty norm 1
    %
    % a_{n,2}(xi)
    %
    then, rescaling, we can write the required integral as
    %
    \[ R^d \sum_{n \in \ZZ^d} \int a_n(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R [\phi(x_1,x_0,\xi) + t^* |\xi|_{x_0}]}\; d\xi. \]
    %
    Notice that $\text{supp}(a_n) \subset \{ |\xi| \sim 1 \}$, and
    %
    \[ |(\nabla_\xi^\kappa a_n)(\xi)| \lesssim_{\kappa,N} |n|^{-N} \| c \|_{L^1(\RR)}. \]
    %
    To obtain an efficient upper bound on this oscillatory integral, it will be convenient to change coordinate systems in a way better respecting the Riemannian metric at $x_0$, i.e. finding a smooth family of diffeomorphisms $\{ F_{x_0}: S^{d-1} \to S^{d-1} \}$ such that $|F_{x_0}|_{x_0} = 1$. We can choose this function such that $F_{x_0}(-x) = - F_{x_0}(x)$. Then if $\tilde{a}_n(\rho, \eta) = a_n( \rho F_{x_0}(\eta) ) JF_{x_0}(\eta)$, then a change of variables gives that
    % 
    \[ \int a_n(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(x_1,x_0,\xi) + t^* |\xi|_{x_0} ]} = \int_0^\infty \rho^{d-1} \int_{|\eta| = 1} \tilde{a}_n(\rho,\eta) e^{2 \pi i R \rho [ \phi(x_1, x_0, F_{x_0}(\eta)) + t^* ]}\; d\eta\; d\rho. \]
    %
    For each fixed $\rho$, we claim that the phase has exactly two stationary points in the $\eta$ variable, at the values $\pm \eta_0$, where $x_1$ lies on the geodesic passing through $x_0$ tangent to the vector $\eta_0^\sharp$ (here we are using the musical isomorphism to map the cotangent vector $\eta_0$ to a tangent vector). Moreover, at these values,
    %
    \[ \phi(x_1,x_0, F_{x_0}(\pm \eta_0)) = \pm d_g(x_1,x_0), \]
    %
    and the Hessian at $\pm \eta_0$ is (positive / negative) definite, with each eigenvalue having magnitude exceeding a constant multiple of $d_g(x_1,x_0)$. It follows from the principle of stationary phase, that the integral above can be written as
    %
    \[ \frac{1}{\left( R d_g(x_1,x_0) \right)^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \sum_{\pm} \int_0^\infty \rho^{\frac{d-1}{2}} f_{n,\pm}(\rho) e^{2 \pi i R \rho [ t^* \pm d_g(x_1,x_0)]}\; d\rho, \]
    %
    where $f_{n,\pm}$ is supported on $|\rho| \sim 1$, and
    %
    \[ |\partial_\rho^m f_{n,\pm}| \lesssim_{m,N} |n|^{-N} \| c \|_{L^1(\RR)}. \]
    %
    Integrating by parts in the $\rho$ variable if $\pm d_g(x_1,x_0) + t^*$ is large, and then taking in absolute values, we conclude that
    %
    \[ \left| \int a_n(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(x_1,x_0,\xi) + t^* |\xi|_{x_0} ]} \right| \lesssim_{N,M} |n|^{-N} \frac{\| c \|_{L^1(\RR)}}{( R d_g(x_1,x_0) )^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \sum_{\pm} \langle R |t^* \pm d_g(x_1,x_0)| \rangle^{-M}. \]
    %
    Taking $N \geq d + 1$, and summing in the $n$ variable, we conclude that
    %
    \[ \left| \sum_n \int a_n(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(x_1,x_0,\xi) + t' |\xi|_{x_0} ]} \right| \lesssim_M \frac{\| c \|_{L^1(\RR)}}{( R d_g(x_1,x_0) )^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \sum_{\pm} \langle R | t^* \pm d_g(x_1,x_0)| \rangle^{-M}. \]
    %
    But this is precisely an estimate for the quantity we wished to estimate. $\qedhere$

%    \[ \int \rho^{d-1} e^{2 \pi i R \rho (t_1 - t_0)} \int_{|\xi| = 1} a(\rho \xi) e^{2 \pi i R \rho \phi(x_1,x_0,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
    % (x_1 - x_0) * xi + O(|x_1 - x_0|^2 |xi|)
%    HOW TO FORMALLY PROVE THAT STATIONARY POINT OCCURS WHEN $\xi$ is pointing in the direction of $x_1$?


%    To finish off our calculation, we will calculate
    %
%    \[ \int a(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R[ x_1 \cdot \xi - \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi) ]}\; d\xi. \]
    %
%    We must now consider the behaviour of the function $\phi$ in more detail.
    % Phase function is x * xi - phi(t,y,xi)
    %
    % Stationary when x = phi_xi(t,y,xi)
    %
    % x-derivative is xi
    % y-derivative is - phi_y(t,y,xi)
    %
    % So Canonical relation of this equation is
    % { (phi_xi, y; xi, phi_y)  }
    %
    % And this should be the canonical relation of the half-wave equation,
    %
    % so (y, phi_y) = Phi_t(phi_xi, xi / |xi|)
    %
    % In the Euclidean case:
    %
    %   y = phi_xi + t xi / |xi|
    %   phi_y = t xi
    %
    %   phi = t |xi| - y * xi
    %
    %   phi_xi = t xi / |xi| - y
    %   phi_y = - xi
    %
    %   y = (t xi / |xi| - y) + t xi
%    The function $\phi$ is constructed via an eikonal equation, and satisfies the partial differential equation
    %
%    \[ (\phi_\xi,\xi) = \Phi_t(y,\phi_y), \]
    %
    % phi_xi = y + t phi_y / |phi_y|
    % xi = phi_y
%    where $\Phi_t$ gives the unit speed geodesic flow at time $t$ in the cotangent space, with respect to the metric induced from $S^{d-1}$. In particular, in the oscillatory integral above, the values of $\xi$ that are stationary satisfy the equation
    %
%    \[ (x_1, \xi) = \Phi_{t_0 - t_1}(x_0, \phi_y). \]
    %
%    and the set of such values of $\xi$ form a ray through the origin. So we consider polar coordinates, writing the integral as
    %
%    \[ \int_0^\infty \int_{|\xi| = 1} \rho^{d-1} a(\rho \xi) e^{2 \pi i \rho R [ x_1 \cdot \xi - \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi) ]}. \]
    %
%    As mentioned above, there is a unit vector $\nu = \nu(x_0,x_1)$ such that the unique non-degenerate stationary point in the integral above in the $\xi$ variable occurs when $\xi = \nu$. It follows that the integral above is
    %
%    \[ R^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \int_{1/2}^2 \rho^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \tilde{a}(\rho)\; d\rho \lesssim R^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}. \]
    %
%    But this means the overall integral is $O(R^{-\frac{3d - 1}{2}})$.

%    TODO: CLEAN UP THE REST OF THIS MESSY CALCULATION BELOW.


%    The uniqueness of geodesic flow tells us that there is a unique ray through the origin, given by the equation $\xi = \rho \nu(x_0,x_1,t_0)$

%     whose values give stationary values of $\xi$.

%    In particular, in the oscillatory integral above, the stationary values of $\xi$ come when $( x_1, \xi ) = \exp( x_0, (t_0 - t_1) \phi_y )$
    


    % In the flat case the integral is (x - y) * xi + t |xi|
    % So phi(t,y,xi) = t |xi| - y * xi
    % [t xi / |xi| - y, xi] = exp( y, - t xi )

%     The canonical relation of the wave equation allows us to determine some of it's behaviour. Namely, we have
    %
%    \[ \nabla_\xi \{ x \cdot \xi - \phi(t,y,\xi) \} = 0 \]
    %
%    if and only if $(\nabla_\xi \phi)(t,y,\xi) = x$, and in such a situation we find that
    %
%    \[ \nabla_x \{ x \cdot \xi - \phi(t,y,\xi) \} = \xi \]
%    \[ \nabla_y \{ x \cdot \xi - \phi(t,y,\xi) \} = - \nabla_y \phi(t,y,\xi), \]
    %
%    and so we conclude that
    %
%    \[ ( - \phi_\xi, \xi ) = \exp( y, \phi_y ) \]

%    The function is obtained from an Eikonal equation,
    %
%    \[ \nabla_\xi \{ x_1 \cdot \xi + \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi) \} = x_1 + \nabla_\xi \]

%    This phase has a stationary point precisely when $(x_1,\xi) = \exp( x_0, (t_0 - t_1) \xi)$

%    We have thus reduced our analysis to
%    %
%    \[ \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t)\; \big\langle (Q_\alpha \circ W_t \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle\; dt. \]
    %
%    s    


%    Using the adjoint calculation above, modulo negligible errors, we can write this integral as
    %
%    \[ \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) \big\langle (\tilde{W}(t) \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, Q_\alpha' E_{x_1} \big\rangle\; du. \]
    %
%    Let
    %
%    \[ a(t,x,y,\xi) = \chi(\xi) s(t,x,y,R \xi), \]
    %
%    and consider
    %
%    \[ R^d \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) a(t,x,w,\xi) \sigma(w,\theta) \sigma^*(x,\zeta) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(t,w,\xi) + \xi \cdot x + \theta \cdot (w - y) - \zeta \cdot (x - z)]}\; d\xi\; d\theta\; d\zeta\; dw\; dz\; dt \]
%    %
%    Write $a(t,x,w,\xi) = a_1(x) a_2(t,w) a_3(\xi)$. If
    %
%    \[ f(\xi) = a_3(\xi) \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) a_2(t,w) \sigma(w,\theta) (\eta_\alpha E_{x_0})(y) e^{2 \pi i R [ [\phi(t,w,\xi) - \phi(t_0 - t_1,x_0,\xi)] + \theta \cdot (w - y) ]}\; dw\; dy\; dt\; d\theta, \]
    %
%    and
    %
%    \[ g(\xi) = \int a_1(x) \sigma^*(x,\zeta) E_{x_1}(x) e^{2 \pi i R \zeta \cdot (x - z) + [ \xi \cdot (x - x_1) ]}\; d\zeta\; dz\; dx. \]
    %
%    Then the integral above is
    %
%    \[ \int f(\xi) \overline{g(\xi)} e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi) + \xi \cdot x_1]}\; d\xi. \]
    %
%    Now $\nabla_\xi \{ \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi) + \xi \cdot x_1 \} = 0$ at a unique value $\xi_1$, where $(x_1,\xi_1) = \exp( x_0, (t_0 - t_1) \nabla_y \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi) )$, and so we get that the integral above is
    %
%    \[ R^{d/2} f( \xi_1 ) \overline{g(\xi_1)}. \]

%    Taking Fourier transforms, 

%    \[ \int a_2(w) \sigma(w,\theta) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(t,w,\xi) - \phi(t_0,x_0,\xi) ]}\; dw \]


%    \[ f(x;t,\xi) = e^{2 \pi i R[\phi(t_0 - t_1,x_0,\xi) - \phi(t,x,\xi)]} Q_\alpha \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}(x), \]
    %
%    and let
    %
%    \[ g(x) = Q_\alpha' \{ E_{x_1} \}(x). \]
    %
%    Using the compactness of the support of $a$, and taking a Fourier series, let us assume that
    %
%    \[ a(t,x,y,\xi) \]

%    Then we can write
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        &\int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) \langle \tilde{W}(t) Q_\alpha E_{x_0}, Q_\alpha' E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\\
%        &\quad\quad = \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) a(t,x,y,\xi / R) f(y;t,\xi / R) e^{2 \pi i [ x \cdot \xi - \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi)]} \overline{g(x)}\; d\xi dx\; dy\; dt\\
%        &\quad\quad = \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) (\mathcal{F} a)(t,\eta,y,\xi / R) e^{-2 \pi i R \phi(t_0 - t_1, x_0, \xi)} f(y;t,\xi) \overline{ \mathcal{F} g(\eta - R \xi)}\; d\xi\; d\eta\; dy\; dt.
%    \end{align*}

%    \[ \int a(t,x,y,\xi / R) f(y;t,\xi) e^{2 \pi i x \cdot (\xi - \eta)}\; d\xi\; dx \]
    %
%    The equation $\phi$ satisfies the following Eikonal equation:
    %
%    \[ ( \nabla_\xi \phi(t,y,\xi), \xi ) = \exp ( y, t \nabla_y \phi(t,y,\xi) ). \]


%    $x = - a(t,y,\xi)$ gives a
    %
%    \[ \nabla_\xi \phi(t,y,\xi) = a \]
    %
%    then $x = -a$, gives a stationary point in the $\xi$ variable, and for this point
    %
%    \[ \nabla_x \{  \} \]

%     we know we must have
    %
%    \[ \nabla_x \]

%    \[ -x = \nabla_\xi \phi(t,y,\xi) \]
    %
%    Then $\nabla_y \phi($
    % x = exp_y(xi)
%    \[ \nabla_y \phi(t,y,\xi) \]

%    WHAT EIKONAL EQUATION DOES THIS $\phi$ SATISFY?

%    \[ \int e^{2 \pi i R x \cdot \xi} f(x;,t,\xi) \]
    %


%    \[ \int a(x,\eta) e^{2 \pi i R[ \phi(x,x_0,\eta) + t_0 |\eta|_{x_0} - \xi \cdot x ]}\; d\eta\; dx\]
    %
    % Probabily only a isngle stationary point, when (x,xi) = exp(x_0, t eta_0)

    %W(t) = int e^{2 pi i ( phi(t,y,eta) - x * eta)}


%    \[  \int a(x,\eta) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(x_0,t_0,\eta) - x \cdot \eta ]} \overline{g(x)}\; d\eta\; dx\; dy\; dt \]

%    For each $y$, consider a diffeomorphism $\exp_y$ that expresses $x$ in geodesic normal coordinates, and consider a polar coordinate system in the $\theta$ variables with respect to the metric on $S^{d-1}$, i.e. writing $\theta = \rho \tilde{\theta}$ with $|\theta|_w = \rho$. Letting $a'$ be the product of $a$ with the relevant Jacobians and $\rho^{d-1}$, we can write the quantity above as
    %
%    \[ R^d \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) a' e^{2 \pi i \rho R \tilde{\Phi}}, \]
    %
%    where
    %
%    \[ \tilde{\Phi}(t,x,y,\rho, \tilde{\theta}) = \phi(\exp_y(x),y,\tilde{\theta}) + t = \tilde{\phi}(x,y,\tilde{\theta}) + t. \]
    %
%    s


%    In the $\tilde{\theta}$ variable, the oscillatory integral has only two stationary points, which we denote by $v_+(x,y)$ and $v_-(x,y)$, and each is non-degenerate. Thus we can write the required integral as
    %
%    \[ R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \sum_{\pm} \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) a_{\pm}(t,x,y,\rho v_{\pm}(x,y)) e^{2 \pi i R [ \phi(x,y,v_{\pm}(x,y)) + t |v_{\pm}(x,y)| ]} \]

%    One nice feature of this coordinate change is that\footnote{TODO: DOUBLE CHECK THIS WITH AN EXPERT} $\phi(\exp_w(z), w, \tilde{\theta}) = z \cdot \tilde{\theta}$. In particular, this implies that, in the $\tilde{\theta}$ variable, this oscillatory integral has only two stationary points, i.e. when
    %
%    \[ \tilde{\theta} = \pm \frac{z}{|z|}. \]
    %
%    The principle of stationary phase thus implies that the integral above
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        \tilde{U}(t,x,y) &= R^{3d - \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{\pm} \int a_{\pm}(t,z,w,\xi,\rho,\xi)\\
%    &\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad e^{2 \pi i R [ \xi \cdot (x - \exp_w(z)) + \rho (t \pm |z|) + \zeta \cdot ( w - y) ]}\; dz\; dw\; d\xi\; d\rho\; d\zeta,
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    where $a_+$ and $a_-$ are compactly supported bump functions satisfying analogous conditions to the function $a'$. Integrating in the $\rho$ variable, we can write $\tilde{U}(t,x,y)$ as
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        R^{3d - \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{\pm} \int (\mathcal{F}^{-1}_{\rho,\xi,\zeta} \widehat{a}_{\pm})(t,z,w,R(x - \exp_w(z)),R (t \pm |z|),R(w - y))\; dz\; dw.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    Taking absolute values in and integrating gives that this integral is
    %
%    \[ R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \langle R ( t \pm d_g(x,y) ) \rangle^{-N}, \]
    %
%    i.e. the integral is concentrated on $\{ (x,y): |t \pm d_g(x,y)| \lesssim 1/R \}$, on which has height $O(R^{\frac{d+1}{2}})$. Integrating in the $x$ and $y$ variables over $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$, we conclude that
    %
%    \[ |\langle (Q \circ W(t) \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle| \lesssim_N R^{\frac{1-3d}{2}} \langle R ( t \pm d_g(x_0,x_1) ) \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
%    Now

%    Now using Parseval's inequality, we obtain that
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        &\int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) \langle \tilde{W}(t) Q_\alpha E_{x_0}, Q_\alpha' E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\\
%        &\quad\quad\quad = \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) v(t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(t,x_0,\eta) + x \cdot \eta ]} f(x) \overline{g}_\alpha(x)\; d\eta\; dx\; dt\\
%        &\quad\quad\quad = \int c_{t_0,t_1}(t) v(t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \phi(t,x_0,\eta)} \widehat{f}(\xi - \eta) \overline{\widehat{g}(\xi)}\; d\eta\; d\xi\; dt
%    \end{align*}


%    Let $U(t) = Q_\alpha \circ W(t) \circ Q_\alpha$, and consider it's kernel $U(t,x,y)$. We have justified that we can write this kernel as an oscillatory integral, i.e. we have
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        U(t,x,y) &= \int \sigma(x,\xi) s(t,z,w,\theta) \sigma(w,\zeta) e^{2 \pi i [ \xi \cdot (x - z) + \phi(t,w,\theta) - z \cdot \theta + \zeta \cdot (w - y) ]}\; dz dw d\xi d\theta d\zeta.
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    On the support of this integral, $|\xi| \sim R$, and we can use this to justify that the only significant contribution occurs when $|\theta| \sim R$. Indeed, if we write the phase as
    %%
%    \[ \Phi(t,x,z,w,y,\xi,\theta,\zeta) = \xi \cdot (x - z) + \phi(t,z,\theta) - w \cdot \theta + \zeta \cdot (w - y), \]
    %
%    then, using the fact that $\nabla_w \Phi = \zeta - \theta$, then for $C > 0$ chosen appropriately large, on the support of the amplitude function, if $|\theta| \leq C^{-1} R$, then
    %
%    \[ |(\nabla_w \Phi)(t,x,z,w,y,\xi,\theta,\zeta)| = |\zeta - \theta| \gtrsim R, \]
    %
%    and for $|\theta| \geq CR$, we have
    %
%    \[ |(\nabla_z \Phi)(t,x,z,w,y,\xi,\theta,\zeta)| \gtrsim |\theta|. \]
    %
%    If $\eta$ is equal to one on $C^{-1} \leq |\theta| \leq C$, and vanishing for $(2C)^{-1} \leq |\theta| \leq 2C$, and we define the operator $\tilde{U}(t)$ to have kernel
    %
%    \begin{align*}
%        \tilde{W}(t,x,y) &= \int \sigma(x,\xi) \chi(\theta / R) s(t,z,w,\theta) \sigma(w,\eta) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,z,w,y,\xi,\theta,\zeta)}\; dz\; dw\; d\xi\; d\theta\; d\zeta,
%    \end{align*}
    %
%    then it follows by integrating by parts enough times in the $w$ variable that
    %
%    \[ |U(t,x,y) - \tilde{U}(t,x,y)| \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \]
    %
%    Now use duality to write, modulo errors of order $O_N(R^{-N})$,
    %
%    \[ \big\langle (Q_\alpha \circ W(t) \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle = \big\langle (Q_\alpha \circ W(t) \circ Q_\alpha) \{ \phi_\alpha E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \big\rangle \]

%    If we define
    %
%    \[ a(t,x,z,w,\xi,\theta,\zeta) = \sigma(x,\xi) \left\{ \chi(\theta / R) s(t,z,w,\theta) \right\} \sigma(w,\eta), \]
    %
%    then $a$ is a smooth, compactly supported function, uniformly in $R$, i.e. supported on $|x|,|z|,|w| \lesssim 1$, and $|\xi|, |\theta|, |\zeta| \sim 1$, and with
    %
%    \[ |\nabla_{t,x,z,w,\xi,\theta,\zeta}^N \{ a \}| \lesssim_N 1 \quad\text{for all $N > 0$}. \]
    %
%    We can rescale the integral defining $\tilde{U}$ in the $\xi$, $\theta$, and $\zeta$ variables, and write
    %
%    \[ \tilde{U}(t,x,y) = R^{3d} \int a\; e^{2 \pi i R \Phi}\; dz\; dw\; d\xi\; d\theta\; d\zeta. \]

    %       So L^1 norm is (Rt_0)^{-s_p)
    % So L^infty norm of c_{t_0t_1} is (Rt_0)^{-s_p} (Rt_1)^{-s_p}
    %
    % Integrating the required bound in t gives that

\begin{remark}
    It might be enlightening to compare this bound to a rescaled version of the analogous bound in the Euclidean setting, obtained in Lemma 3.3 of \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger}. Consider a radial multiplier $m: \RR^d \to \CC$, i.e. with $m(\xi) = h(|\xi|)$. The Fourier multiplier $M_R$ with symbol $m( \cdot / R)$ can then be given by convolution against the kernel
    %
    \[ k_R(x) = \int_0^\infty [ R \widehat{h}(Rt) ] k_t(x)\; dt, \]

    where $k_t$ is the Fourier transform of $e^{2 \pi i t |\xi|}$. The dilation symmetry of Euclideans pace implies that
    %
    \[ k_t = t^{-d}\; \text{Dil}_t k, \]
    %
    where we let $k = k_1$. We can compute that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        k(x) &= \int e^{2 \pi i [|\xi| + \xi \cdot x]}\; d\xi\\
        &= |x|^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \int_0^\infty r^{d/2} e^{2 \pi i r} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}( 2 \pi r |x| ).
    \end{align*}
    %
    Consider a cutoff for $r \leq 2 / |x|$, i.e. letting
    %
    \[ k_L(x) = |x|^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \int_0^\infty \chi(r |x|) r^{d/2} e^{2 \pi i r} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(2 \pi r |x|). \]
    %
    We can rescale this quantity, writing it as
    %
    \[ |x|^{-d} \int_0^\infty \chi(r) r^{d/2} e^{2 \pi i r / |x|} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(2 \pi r). \]
    %
    The quantity $r^{d/2} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(r)$ has a zero of order $d-1$ at $r = 0$. Integrating by parts $d$ times thus gives that
    %
    \[ k_L(x) = C_d + \int_0^\infty \tilde{\chi}(r) e^{2 \pi i r / |x|} \]
    %
    for some constant $C_d$ and some smooth, compactly supported function $\tilde{\chi}$. This is sufficient to conclude that $k_L$ is a symbol of order zero. Next, we analyze the integral
    %
    \[ k_H(x) = |x|^{- \frac{d-2}{2}} \int_0^\infty [1 - \chi(r |x|)] r^{d/2} e^{2 \pi i r} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(2 \pi r |x|). \]
    %
    Bessel function asymptotics allow us to write
    %
    \[ J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(s) = \sum_{\pm} s^{-1/2} e^{\pm 2 \pi i s} a_{\pm}(s), \]
    %
    where $a_{\pm}$ are symbols of order zero. Thus, rescaling and introducing this asymptotic, we can write the integral above as
    %
    \[ k_H(x) = |x|^{-d} \sum_{\pm} \int_0^\infty [1 - \chi(r)] r^{\frac{d-1}{2}} e^{2 \pi i r [ 1/|x| \pm 1]} a_{\pm}(r)\; dr. \]
    %
    If we write $a_{\pm,0}(r) = [1 - \chi(r)] r^{\frac{d-1}{2}} a_{\pm}(r)$, then $a_{\pm,0}$ is a symbol of order $(d-1)/2$, and the required integral can then be expressed as
    % -(d+1)/2
    \[ |x|^{-d} \sum_{\pm} \widehat{a}_{\pm,0}(1/|x| \pm 1), \] 
    %
    where $\widehat{a}_{\pm,0}$ has a singularity of order $-(d+1)/2$ at the origin, and rapidly decays away from this singularity. In other words, for $|x| \leq 1/2$,
    %
    \[ |\partial_{\text{Rad}}^\alpha k(x)| \lesssim_{\alpha} 1, \]
    %
    for $1/2 \leq |x| \leq 2$,
    % |1 - |x||^{-(d+1)/2}
    \[ |\partial_{\text{Rad}}^\alpha k(x)| \lesssim_\alpha |1 - |x||^{- \frac{d+1}{2} - \alpha}, \]
    %
    and for $|x| \geq 2$,
    %
    \[ |\partial_{\text{Rad}}^\alpha k(x)| \lesssim_\alpha |x|^{-d - \alpha}. \]
    %
    BLEH

    % Contributions from |x| >= 2 are O(1), rapidly decaying for |xi| >> 1
    % The same for for |x| <= 1/2
    % For

    % We might expect the ~1 Frequency Cutoff to make k
    % behave like 
    % 2^j s + 2^{-j} (r/s) |xi|
    % s^2 = 4^{-j} r |xi|
    % s = 2^{-j} r^{1/2} |xi|^{1/2}

    The function $k$ should behave like
    %
    \[ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 2^{k \frac{d+1}{2}} \chi( 2^k ||x| - 1| ). \]
    %
    Now $\chi( 2^k ||\cdot| - 1|)$ is a Bochner Riesz bump function, and thus it's Fourier transform behaves like $2^{-k} |\xi|^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} e^{2 \pi i |\xi|}$. Once localized to $|\xi| \sim 1$, it's Fourier transform looks like $2^{-k} \chi(\xi) e^{2 \pi i |\xi|}$,

    The function $k$ should behave like
    %
    \[ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 2^{k \frac{d+1}{2}} \chi( 2^k ||x| - 1| ) \]
    \[ \chi(\xi) \int_0^\infty \chi( 2^k |r - 1| ) r^{d/2} e^{2 \pi i r} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(\lambda r)\; dr \]
    \[ \chi(\xi) \int_0^\infty \chi( 2^k |r - 1| ) r^{\frac{d-1}{2}} e^{2 \pi i r [1 \pm \lambda]}\; dr \]


    \[ \chi(\xi) \int_0^\infty r^{d/2} \chi(|r - 1| / 2^k) e^{2 \pi i r} J_{\frac{d-2}{2}}(r) \]


    How about when we average the half-wave equation now over time?

    \end{align*}
    \[ \int [R \widehat{h}(R(t - t_0))] t^{-d} k_L(x/t)\; dt \]

    This quantity can then be written as
    %
    \[ |x|^{-d} |x|^{-(d+1)/2} |1/|x| +/- 1|^{-(d+1)/2} \]

    As $|x| \to 1$, this quantity has a singularity of order $-(d+1)/2$

    % |x|^{-d} int chi(r) r^{d/2} e^{2 pi i r LAMBDA} J(r)
    % 
    This is the integral of a function compactly supported near the origin, and so a Taylor expansion argument (TODO) shows that this quantity is $|x|^{d/2}$.

    %if we apply a cutoff
    %
    %\[ |x|^{-d} \int_0^\infty \chi(r) r^{d/2 + \alpha + 2k} e^{2 \pi i r / |x|} \]
    %
    %If we integrate by parts in the $r$ variable $d/2 + \alpha + 2k$ times, we end up with
    %
    %\[ |x|^{\alpha + 2k - d/2} \int_0^\infty \tilde{\chi}(r) e^{2 \pi i r / |x|}, \]
    %
    %where $\tilde{\chi}(0) \neq 0$. And so it follows that this quantity is equal to
    %
    %\[ |x|^{\alpha + 2k - d/2} \psi(|x|) \]
    %
    % for a function $\psi$, analytic in $|x|$.

    \[ \int_0^\infty \chi(|x| r) r^{d/2} e^{2 \pi i r} (r x)^{\alpha + 2k} \]

    We consider the term

        &\quad = |x|^{-1-d/2} \int_0^\infty r^{\frac{d}{2}} e^{2 \pi i r / |x|} \tilde{\chi}(r)\; dr.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Integrating by parts gives that this quantity is can be written as
    %
    \[ |x|^{d/2 - 1} \chi(|x|), \]
    %
    for some smooth function $\chi$, nonvanishing at the origin.

    The function $\tilde{\chi}$ has a zero of order $d/2 - 1$ at the origin, which implies that this
    %
    \[ |x|^{d/2 - 1} [ A  ] \int_0^\infty \partial_r^{d-1} \{ r^{d/2} \tilde{\chi}(r) \} e^{2 \pi i r / |x|} \]

    We consider a cutoff function $\chi(|x| r)$

    TODO: Asymptotics for $r \leq 1/|x|$.

    Using Bessel asymptotics, we write

\begin{comment}

Each of the operators $Q_\alpha$, $W(u)$, and $Q_\alpha$ is given by an oscillatory integral in the coordinates $z_\alpha$, 

%
\[ Q \circ A(u) \]

This smoothness implies that
%
\[ \| \mathcal{P}_\lambda \{ B(t,s,\cdot,y) \} \|_{L^\infty(S^d)} \lesssim_N \lambda^{-N}, \]
%
and this together with the Weyl Law and the triangle inequality is sufficient to conclude that the kernel $K(t,s,x,y)$ of $Q \circ B(t,s)$ satisfies bounds of the form
%
\[ |K(t,s,x,y)| = \left| \sum \beta(\lambda / R) \mathcal{P}_\lambda \{ B(t,s,\cdot,y) \} \right| \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \]
%
Schur's Lemma, applied to $Q \circ B(t,s)$, together with the uniform boundedness of $Q$, implies that
%
\[ \| (Q \circ B(t,s) \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \} \|_{L^2(S^d)} \lesssim_N R^{-N} |E_{x_0}|^{1/2} \]
%
and so Cauchy-Schwartz implies that
%
\begin{align*}
    &\left| \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b_{t_1}(s)} \langle (Q \circ B(t,s) \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; ds \right|\\
    &\quad \lesssim_N R^{-N} \int |b_{t_0}(t)| |b_{t_1}(s)| |E_{x_0}|^{1/2} |E_{x_1}|^{1/2}\; dt\; ds\\
    &\quad\lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}.
\end{align*}




$t$, $x$, and $y$, and $W(t)$ is a Schwartz operator, with kernel satisfying
%
\[ \text{supp}(W) \subset \{ (t,x,y) : d(x,y) \leq t + 0.01 \}, \]
%
and such that, if we consider Schwartz operators $\{ W_\alpha(t) \}$ with kernel
%
\[ W_\alpha(t,x,y) = \tilde{\eta}_\alpha(x) W(t,x,y) \tilde{\eta}_\alpha(y), \]
%
then $W(t) = \sum W_\alpha(t)$, and each operator $W_\alpha(t)$ can, in the coordinate system $U_\alpha$, be given as a Fourier integral with canonical relation supported in the geodesic light cone, i.e. for each $\alpha$, there exists a symbol $s$ of order zero, and a phase function $\Phi$ such that the pushforward operator $W_\alpha^{z_\alpha}(t)$ has kernel
%
\[ W_\alpha^{z_\alpha}(t,x,y) = \int s(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi, \]
%
where $\Phi(t,x,y,\xi) = \phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi_y|_g$, and where $\exp$ denotes the geodesic flow in cotangent space. Let us use this decomposition to write $II = II_W + II_A$, where
%
\[ II_W = \int b(t) W(t)\; dt \quad\text{and}\quad II_A = \int b(t) A(t)\; dt. \]

We now consider quantities of the form
%
\[ \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \int c_{t_0,t_1}(u) \langle (Q \circ W_\alpha(u) \circ Q) \{ \phi_\beta \cdot E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle \]



It thus follows that if we define $\widetilde{W}(u) = \tilde{Q} \circ W(u) \circ \tilde{Q}$, then (TODO: Double Check Calculation)
%
\begin{equation} \label{firstreductionorthogonal}
    \left| \langle \ess_{x_0,t_0}, \ess_{x_1,t_1} \rangle - \int c_{t_0,t_1}(u) \langle \widetilde{W}(u) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; du \right| \lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N},
\end{equation}
%
We note, for later use, that $c_{t_0,t_1}$ is supported in a $O(1/R)$ neighborhood of $t_0 - t_1$.

Now let's perform some calculations in each coordinate system $\{ U_\alpha \}$. For each $E_{x_0}$, our reductions show that $|\langle \ess_{x_0,t_0}, \ess_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}$ unless $d(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}) \leq 1/50$. For any $\alpha$ such that $(W_\alpha(u) \circ \tilde{Q}) \{ E_{x_0} \} \neq 0$, it therefore follows that $E_{x_1} \subset U_\alpha$. And to determine the $L^2$ product, it thus suffices to find a representation of $\tilde{Q} \circ W_\alpha \circ \tilde{Q}$ in the coordinate system $U_\alpha$.


%
\[ \int c_{t_0,t_1}(u) \langle \tilde{W}_\alpha(u) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; du. \]
%


We now wish to perform some computations in the coordinate system $U_\alpha$. In order to do this, we need an expression for $Q$ in the coordinate system, and to do this we rely on the following Lemma, 

It follows from this lemma and \eqref{firstreductionorthogonal} (TODO: Check Calculation) that
%
\[ \left| \langle \ess_{x_0,t_0}, \ess_{x_1,t_1} \rangle - \int c_{t_0,t_1}(u) \langle (\tilde{Q} \circ W(t) \circ \tilde{Q}) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; du \right| \lesssim_N C_p(h)^2 R^{-N}. \]

If $d(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}) \geq 2/100$, then we can use the pseudolocality of the operators $Q$, together with the finite propogation speed of the Lax parametrix, to show the interactions between $\ess_{t_0,x_0}$ and $\ess_{t_1,x_1}$ are completely negligible. TODO: Get $O_N(R^{-N} C_p(h)^2)$ error.

On the other hand, if $d(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}) \leq 2/100$, then we can find a single coordinate system compactly containing $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$.

We now wish to make the assumption that $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$ lie in a single coordinate system, and to work with the Lax parametrix in this coordinate system. Let us begin by choosing finitely many coordinate charts $\{ \theta \}$ such that for any $x_0,x_1 \in \mathcal{X}$, if $d(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}) \leq 1/10$, then $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$ both are compactly contained in the domain of one of the coordinate charts $\theta$. For any $t_0, t_1 \in \mathcal{T}$, the support of $c_{t_0,t_1}$ is contained in $\{ s : |s - (t_0 - t_1)| \leq 1/100 \}$, and since $|t_0|, |t_1| \leq 1/100$, contained in $\{ |s| \leq 1/49 \}$. The fact that $W(u)$ is supported on $\{ (x,y): d(x,y) \leq u + 1/100 \}$, together with the pseudolocality of $Q$, means it is natural to expect that $\langle (Q \circ W(u) \circ Q) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle$ will only be non-negligible when $d(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}) \leq 1/10$. But the operator $Q$ is not local, so we must verify this precisely.

In this calculation, it will be helpful in that analysis to use the methods of this section to characterize the `large time' behaviour of the projection operators $Q$ introduced in Remark 3 of the introduction. We write $Q = Q^{\text{Low}} + Q^{\text{High}}$, where
%
\[ Q^{\text{Low}} = \int \chi(t) \widehat{\beta}_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt \quad\text{and}\quad Q^{\text{High}} = \int (1 - \chi(t)) \widehat{\beta}_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt \]
%
for some $\chi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ equal to one for $|t| \leq 1/200$ and vanishing for $|t| \leq 1/100$. We rely on a periodization argument, like in our analysis of the operators $\{ III_R \}$, to show the behaviour of the operator $Q^{\text{High}}$ can be safely disregarded.

\begin{lemma} \label{LargeTimeQBounds}
    The operators $\{ Q^{\text{High}} \}$ are uniformly negligible.
%    The kernel $Q_R^{\text{High}}(x,y)$ of $Q_R^{\text{High}}$ satisfies
%    %
%    \[ |\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta Q_R^{\text{High}}(x,y)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,N} R^{-N} \quad\text{for all $N \geq 0$}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    For $t \in [-1/2,1/2]$, define
    %
    \[ H(t) = \sum_l (1 - \chi(t + l)) R \widehat{\beta}(R (t + l)). \]
    %
    Unlike $h$, the function $\beta$ is smooth and compactly supported, and thus $\widehat{\beta}$ is rapidly decaying, which allows us to conclude that for each $k$, we have $|\partial_t^k H(t)| \lesssim_{k,N} R^{-N}$ for all $N \geq 0$. Now
    %
    \[ (\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta Q^{\text{High}})(x,y) = \int H_R(t) (\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta e^{2 \pi i t P})(x,y)\; dt \]
    %
    If $M$ is a sufficiently large integer, we `integrate by parts', writing
    %
    \[ \int H(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt = \int \langle D_t \rangle^{M/2} \{ H \} \langle D_t \rangle^{-M/2} \{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}\; dt, \]
    %
    where we view $\langle D_t \rangle = (1 + D_t^2)^{1/2}$ is a positive definite self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator of order $1$. The derivative estimates on $H$ imply that we have $|\langle D_t \rangle^{M/2} \{ H \}| \lesssim_{N,M} R^{-N}$ for any $N > 0$. On the other hand, $t \mapsto \partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta e^{2 \pi i t P}$ is a smooth parameterization of a family of Fourier integral operators of order $|\alpha| + |\beta|$ on $S^d$. The composition calculus for Fourier integral operators thus implies that $t \mapsto \langle D_t \rangle^{-M/2} \{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$ is a parameterized family of Fourier integral operators of order $|\alpha| + |\beta| - M$. If $M$ is sufficiently large, we conclude that the kernels of these Fourier integral operators are bounded, uniformly in $|t| \leq 1/2$ by virtue of the smoothness of the parameterization. But this implies the required kernel estimates, namely
    %
    \[ |(\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta Q^{\text{High}})(x,y)| \lesssim_N R^{-N} \int_{|t| \leq 1/2} |\langle D_t \rangle^{-M/2} \{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}(x,y)| \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \qedhere \]
\end{proof}

It follows that $Q \circ W(u) \circ Q$ differs from $Q^{\text{Low}} \circ W(u) \circ Q^{\text{Low}}$ by a uniformly negligible family of operators. Now we have done this, we can use the Lax parametrix to understand $Q^{\text{Low}}$, namely, writing $Q^{\text{Low}} = Q^{\text{Low}}_W + Q^{\text{Low}}_A$, where
%
\[ Q^W = \int \widehat{\beta}_R(t) W(t)\; dt \quad\text{and}\quad Q^A = \int \widehat{\beta}_R(t) A(t), \]
%
for smoothing operators $\{ A(t) \}$. We claim that $Q^{\text{Low}} \circ W(u) \circ Q^{\text{Low}}$ also differs from $Q^W \circ W(u) \circ Q^W$ by a uniformly negligible family of operators.

\begin{lemma}
    The operator $Q^{\text{Low}} \circ W(u) \circ Q^{\text{Low}}$ differs from $Q^W \circ W(u) \circ Q^W$ by a uniformly negligible family of operators.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    First off, $A(t) \circ W(u)$ has a kernel which is a smooth function of $t$ and $u$. It follows, as with the analysis of the smoothing operators $B(t,s)$ applied to $Q$, that $A(t) \circ W(u) \circ Q$ has a kernel which is pointwise $O_N(R^{-N})$. But since $Q^{\text{High}}$ is self-adjoint, we also know that $A(t) \circ W(u) \circ Q^{\text{High}}$ has a kernel which is pointwise $O_N(R^{-N)}$, and so $A(t) \circ W(u) \circ Q^{\text{Low}}$ has a kernel which is $O_N(R^{-N})$. This shows $Q^A \circ W(u) \circ Q^{\text{Low}}$ is uniformly negligible, and it remains to analyze $Q^W \circ W(u) \circ Q^A$ is uniformly negligible. But we can write this operator as
    %
    \[ \int \widehat{\beta}_R(t) Q^W \circ W(u) \circ A(t)\; du\; dt. \]
    %
    Taking Fourier transforms in the $t$ variable, we can write this as
    %
    \[ \int \beta(\lambda / R) Q^W \circ W(u) \circ \widehat{A}(\lambda)\; du\; d\lambda. \]
    %
    The fact that $A$ is smooth, and compactly supported in the $t$ variable, implies that $\widehat{A}$ is rapidly decaying in $\lambda$, which gives the require $O_N(R^{-N})$ estimates given that $\beta(\lambda / R)$ is supported on $|\lambda| \sim R$.
\end{proof}

Modulo errors of order $O_N(C_p(h)^2 R^{-N})$ for arbtrarily large $N$, we have therefore reduced our analysis of $\langle \ess_{x_0,t_0}, \ess_{x_1,t_1} \rangle$ to quantities of the form $\langle T E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle$, where
%
\[ T = \int c(u) (Q^W \circ W(u) \circ Q^W)\; du. \]
%
Because $Q^W$ is now defined in terms of the Lax parametrix, this operator now has support on $\{ (x,y): d(x,y) \leq 1/50 \}$, which implies that $\langle T E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle = 0$ unless $d(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}) \leq 1/10$. Thus when this quantity is non-zero, we can find a coordinate system $\theta$ from the finite family we have selected, such that $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$ are compactly contained in the domain of $\theta$. We will now compute quantities associated with $T$ in this coordinate system.

First, let's study the behaviour of $(Q^W)^\theta$. This operator is, modulo neglible terms, the projection operator onto eigenvalues of the Laplacian of $S^d$ with eigenvalue $\sim R$. Given ellipticity, we should expect that, in coordinates, modulo some extra error terms, the same is true.

\begin{lemma}
    Modulo uniformly negligible terms, the operator $(Q^W)^\theta$ is a pseudodifferential operator on $\RR^d$, and we can write it's symbol as $s(x, \xi / R)$, where $\text{supp}_\xi(s) \subset \{ 1/5 \leq |\xi| \leq 5 \}$, and $|\partial^\alpha_x \partial^\beta_\xi s(x,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta} 1$, uniformly in $R$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    TODO: Did calculation in notes.
\end{proof}

Since $s(x,D)$ behaves like a variable-coefficient Fourier cutoff at a scale $R$, we should be able to use this to isolate the behaviour of the Lax parametrix $W(u)$ at this same scale.

\begin{lemma}
    Modulo uniformly negligible terms, the operator $s(x,D) \circ W(u)$ is equal to $s(x,D) \circ \tilde{W}(u)$, where $\tilde{W}(u)$ is expressed as a Fourier integral of the form
    %
    \[ \int a(u,x,y,\xi / R) e^{2 \pi i \phi(u,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi, \]
    %
    where $a$ satisfies estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |\partial_u^\alpha \partial_x^\beta \partial_y^\delta \partial_\xi^\epsilon a(u,x,y,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta,\delta,\epsilon} 1, \]
    %
    and $\text{supp}_\xi(a) \subset \{ |\xi| \sim 1 \}$.

\begin{comment}

by reducing our analysis to a study of the operator in coordinates. We cover $S^d$ by a family of coordinate charts $\{ \theta \}$, and then perform a decomposition $II_W = \sum II_{W,i}$ and $Q^{\text{Low}}_W = \sum Q_{W,j}$ by applying a partition of unity to the kernels, such that the following property holds: for any two indices $i$ and $j$, such that $II_{W,i} \circ Q_{W,j} \neq 0$, there exists a coordinate system $\theta$ such that the kernels of $II_{W,i}$ and $Q_{W,j}$ both have support on a compact subset of $\theta$ (here we are using the fact that we are only looking at the \emph{small time} behaviour of the operators with respect to the wave equation, so that the kernels of the operators are supported on a small neighborhood of the diagonal). Applying the fact that the sum $\sum II_{W,i} \circ Q^{\text{Low}}_{W,j}$ is finite, it suffices to bound each term individually, and we do this by pushing forward our operator into coordinates. Let
%
\[ \mathsf{II} = II_{W,i}^\theta \quad\text{and}\quad \mathsf{Q} = Q^{\text{Low},\theta}_{W,j}. \]
%
be the pushforward operators, now defined mpaping functions on $\RR^d$ to functions on $\RR^d$. It will suffice to obtain $L^p$ estimates for $\mathsf{II} \circ \mathsf{Q}$ that are independent of $R$.

We will be aided in this analysis by an expression for the Lax parametrix in the coordinate system $\theta$.


 We will obtain bounds for this operator given some restricted bounds. So let us consider an analysis of functions of the form $S = (II_W \circ Q^{\text{Low}}_W) \{ E \}$, for some fixed measurable set $E \subset S^d$.  The pushforward operator $T_W^\theta$ has a kernel $K_\theta$ defined by an oscillatory integral distribution
%
\[ K_\theta(x,y) = a_\theta(x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \varphi_\theta(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi_y|_{g(y)} ]}\; d\xi, \]
%
where the amplitude $a_\theta$ is a symbol of order zero, with compact $(x,y)$ support, the phase $\varphi$ is smooth, and we have
%
\[ \varphi_\theta(x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi, \]
%
in the sense that
%
\[ |\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\lambda \{ \varphi_\theta(x,y,\xi) - (x - y) \cdot \xi \}| \lesssim |x - y|^2 |\xi|^{2 - \lambda}, \]
%
and where $|\xi|_{g(y)} = (\sum g^{ij}(y) \xi_i \xi_j )^{1/2}$ gives the length of the covector $\xi$ with respect to the Riemannian metric $g$. Let us write $\phi_\theta$ for $\varphi_\theta + t |\xi|_g$.

Becuase $II_W \circ Q_W$ breaks down into a finite sum of terms of the form $II_{W,i} \circ Q_{W,j}$, it suffices to bound each of these terms separately, and to do this, without loss of generality it suffices to bound $\mathcal{II} \circ \mathcal{Q}$, where $\mathcal{II} = II_{W,i}^\theta$, and $\mathcal{Q} = Q_{W,j}^\theta$. We will obtain bounds for this operator using restricted bounds. We consider $E \subset \RR^d$, and try and find bounds on the function $S = \mathcal{II} \circ \mathcal{Q} \{ E \}$. Since the operators have compact kernels, we may assume $E$ is contained in a large ball about the origin of radius $O(1)$.




%
and so
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle S_{x_0,t_0}, S_{x_1,t_1} \rangle &= \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \Big\langle T_W(t) \{ E_{x_0} \}, T_W(t') \{ E_{x_1} \} \Big\rangle\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_W^*(t') \circ T_W(t) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \Big[ \langle T_W(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle + \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle \Big]\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int (b_{t_0} * \overline{b}_{t_1})(t) \langle T_W(t) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\\
    &\quad\quad+ \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt'.
\end{align*}
%
Write
%
\[ G_{x_0,x_1}(t,t') = \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle. \]
%
Then $G_{x_0,x_1}$ satisfies estimates of the form
%
\[ \Big| \partial_t^k \partial_{t'}^l G_{x_0,x_1} \Big| \lesssim_{k,l} 1 \]


\[ \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt' \]


%
Smoothness should guarantee that the term corresponding to $\langle T_R E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle$ is negligible, so we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle f_{x_0,t_0}, f_{x_1,t_1} \rangle &\approx \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b_{t_1}(t')} \langle T_W(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int (b_{t_0} * b_{t_1}^*)(s) \langle T_W(s) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; ds.
\end{align*}
%
an integral supported for $s$ in a $O(1/R)$ neighborhood of $t_0-t_1$. Let us write $c_{t_0,t_1} = b_{t_0} * b_{t_1}^*$. We have good control over the $L^p$ norms of $b_{t_0}$ and $b_{t_1}$, and so by Young's inequality, we have good control over the $L^q$ norm of $c_{t_0,t_1}$, where $q = p/(2-p)$; As we get close to the optimal range, $q$ increases until it gets arbitrarily close to $d$. However, since $c_{t_0,t_1}$ has compact support, we can decrease $q$ as a tradeoff for powers of $R$, and we can increase $q$ as a tradeoff against powers of $R$ since $c_{t_0,t_1}$ has Fourier transform supported on a ball of radius $R$.

To further study this quantity, we have
%
\[ \langle T_W(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle = \sum_\theta \langle T_{W,\theta}(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle, \ \langle T_W(t) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt + \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_{A'} E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle \]
%
where $\theta$ ranges over all coordinate charts whose domains contain $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$ (the other charts we may ignore, by the support properties of the operators making up the Lax parametrix).  If we let $E_{x_0}^\theta$ and $E_{x_0}^\theta$ denote the images of these two sets in the coordinate chart, then we can write
%
\[ \langle T_{W,\theta}(s) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle = \int_{E_{x_0}^\theta} \int_{E_{x_1}^\theta} \int a_\theta(s,x,y,\xi) \chi(\xi / R) e^{2 \pi i \phi_\theta(s,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dx\; dy. \]
%
For each $y$, consider a smooth function $F_y$ defined on $\text{supp}_x a_\theta$, such that
%
\[ \exp_y(F_y^{-1}(x)) = x, \]
%
where $\exp_y$ is the geodesic flow emerging from $y$. If
%
\[ a'_\theta(s,z,y,\xi) = |\det(DF_y(z))| a_\theta(s,F_y(z),y,\xi), \]
%
then we can rewrite the oscillatory sum above as
%
\[ R^d \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \int a'_\theta(s,z,y,R \xi) \chi(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R \phi_\theta(s,F_y(z),y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dz\; dy. \]
%
Let us now perform a polar coordinate decomposition in $\xi$, i.e. writing $\xi = \rho \omega$, where $\rho = |\xi|_{g(y)}$ and $\omega$ ranges over $\Sigma_y$. Writing $\alpha(y,\omega) = \langle n(y,\omega), \omega \rangle$, then
%
\[ a''_\theta(s,z,y,\rho,\omega) = \alpha(y,\omega) a'_\theta(s,z,y,\rho \omega), \]
%
then we obtain that the sum is
%
\[ R^d \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \int \int \rho^{d-1} a''_\theta(s,z,y,R \rho, \omega) \chi(\rho \omega) e^{2 \pi i R \rho \phi_\theta(s,F_y(z),y,\omega)}\; d\omega\; d\rho\; dz\; dy. \]
%
Applying the principle of nonstationary phase in the $\omega$ variable, which for any value of $y$, $z$, and $\rho$, is only stationary when $\omega = z / |z|$, we conclude that there is a symbol $\tilde{a}_\theta$ of order $-(d-1)/2$ such that the oscillatory integral is
%
\[ R^d \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \int \rho^{d-1} \tilde{a}_\theta(s,z,y,R \rho) \chi(\rho) e^{2 \pi i R \rho (s + |z|)}\; ds\; dz\; dy. \]
%
Imagining that $\tilde{a}_\theta(s,z,y, R \rho) \approx \eta(s,z,y) (R \rho)^{-(d-1)/2}$, we conclude that the integral should behave like
%
\[ R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \eta(s,z,y) (\partial^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \widehat{\chi})(R(s + |z|))\; dz\; dy \]
%
TODO: Integrate by parts in $z$ now? IS THE FACT THAT WE ABSORBED THE SYMBOL INTO $\eta$ BAD, i.e. so that differentiating in $z$ orthogonally behaves differently? If we now reintroduce the integral in time, we have to now analyze
%
\[ R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \int \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} c_{t_0,t_1}(s) \eta(s,y,z) (\partial^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \widehat{\chi} )(R(s + |z|))\; dz\; dy\; ds. \]
%
TODO: Does integrating by parts in the $t$ and $t'$ variable do anything for us? Is this where we need oscillation. If $|t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1)| \geq 10/R$, then we conclude this quantity is
%
\begin{align*}
    & O_N \Big( R^{\frac{d+1}{2}-N} \int \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} |c_{t_0,t_1}(s)| |\eta(s,y,z)| (s + |z|)^{-N}\; dz\; dy\; ds \Big)\\
    &\quad\quad O_N \Big( R^{\frac{d+1}{2} - N} |t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1)|^{-N} |E_{x_0}| |E_{x_1}| \| c_{t_0,t_1} \|_{L^1} \Big)
\end{align*}
%
If $|E_{x_0}|$ and $|E_{x_1}|$ are both proportional to $1/R^d$, then this quantity is
%
\begin{align*}
    & O_N \Big( R^{-\frac{3d-1}{2} - N} |t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1)|^{-N} \| c_{t_0,t_1} \|_{L^1} \Big)\\

Now applying this Lemma with $c = c_{t_0,t_1}$, and then summing in $\alpha$, we complete the proof of Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma}.


\section{Analysis of $II_R$: Density Decompositions}

Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma} of the last section implies two functions ${S\!}_{x_0,t_0}$ and ${S\!}_{x_1,t_1}$ can only be correlated in $L^2$ if $d_g(x_0,x_1) \approx |t_0 - t_1|$. We now exploit this geometry to obtain some $L^2$ estimates for sums of the functions ${S\!}_{x_0,t_0}$.

\begin{lemma}
    Fix $u \geq 1$. Consider a set $\mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{T}$. Write
    %
    \[ \mathcal{E} = \bigcup_{k = 0}^\infty \mathcal{E}_k, \]
    %
    where $\mathcal{E}_k = \{ (x,t) \in \mathcal{E}: |t| \sim 2^k / R \}$. Suppose that each of the sets $\mathcal{E}_k$ has density type $(Ru,2^k / R)$, i.e. for any set $B \subset \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{T}$ with $\text{diam}(B) \leq 2^k / R$,
    %
    \[ \#( \mathcal{E}_k \cap B ) \leq Ru\; \text{diam}(B). \]
    %
    Then
    %
    \[ \left\| \sum_k \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} {S\!}_{x_0,t_0} \right\|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim R^{d-2} \log_2(u) u^{\frac{2}{d-1}} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
\end{lemma}

Write $F = \sum F_k$, where
%
\[ F_k = 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}} {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}. \]
%
Applying Cauchy-Schwartz, we have
%
\[ \| F \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim \log_2(u) \left( \sum_{k \lesssim \log_2(u)} \| F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 + \| \sum_{k \gtrsim \log_2(u)} F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \right). \]
%
Without loss of generality by increasing the implicit constant, we can assume that $\{ k : \mathcal{E}_k \neq \emptyset \}$ is $10$-separated, and that all values of $t$ with $(x,t) \in \mathcal{E}$ are positive (the case where all values of $t$ being negative being treated analogously). Thus if $F_k$ and $F_{k'}$ are both nonzero, then $k = k'$ or $|k - k'| \geq 10$. For $k \geq k' + 10$, let us estimate $\langle F_k, F_{k'} \rangle$. We can decompose this inner product into a sum of quantities of the form $2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle$, where $t_0 \sim 2^k / R$ and $t_1 \sim 2^{k'} / R$. Now consider the two sets
%
\[ \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,\text{low}} = \{ (x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{E}_{k'} : |d_g(x_0,x_1) - (t_0 - t_1)| \lesssim 2^{k' + 10} / R \} \]
%
and for $l \geq k' + 10$, consider the set
%
\[ \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l} = \{ (x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{E}_{k'} : |d_g(x_0,x_1) - (t_0 - t_1)| \sim 2^l / R \}. \]
%
Let us use the density properties of $\mathcal{E}$ to control the size of these index sets. First, note that for any $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k$ and $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{E}_{k'}$, $t_0 - t_1$ lies in a radius $O(2^{k'} / R)$ interval centered at $t_0$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let us first estimate interactions between the functions ${S\!}_{x_0,t_0}$ and ${S\!}_{x_1,t_1}$ with $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,\text{low}}$. If $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,\text{low}}$, then $x_1$ must lie in a width $O(2^{k'} / R)$ and radius $O(2^k / R)$ annulus centered at $x_0$. Thus $\mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,\text{low}}$ is covered by $O( 2^{(k-k')(d-1)} )$ balls of radius $2^{k'} / R$. The density properties of $\mathcal{E}_{k'}$ implies that
    %
    \[ \# \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim Ru\; 2^{(k-k')(d-1)} (2^{k'} / R) = u 2^{(k-k')(d-1) + k'}. \]
    %
    Together with Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma}, we conclude that
    %
    \[ 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,\text{low}}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_M R^{d-2} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \Big( u 2^{(k-k')(d-1) + k'} \Big) \Big( 2^{-k \frac{d-1}{2}} \Big). \]
    %
    We can now sum over $\log_2(u) \lesssim k' \leq k - 10$ and $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k$ to find
    % d = 2: get an extra O( log k ) factor
    \[ 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \sum_{k' \leq k - 10} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,\text{low}}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k (d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]

    \item Next, let's estimate interactions between the functions ${S\!}_{x_0,t_0}$ and ${S\!}_{x_1,t_1}$ with $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ with $k' + 10 \leq l \leq k - 5$. If $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}$, then $x_1$ must lie in one of two geodesic annuli centered at $x_0$, each width $O(2^l/R)$ and radii $O(2^k / R)$. Thus $\mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ is covered by $O( 2^{(l-k')} 2^{(k-k')(d-1)} )$ balls of radius $2^{k'} / R$, and the density of $\mathcal{E}_{k'}$ implies that
    %
    \[ \# \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim Ru\; 2^{(l-k')} 2^{(k-k')(d-1)} 2^{k'} / R = u 2^{l} 2^{(k-k')(d-1)}. \]
    %
    Together with Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma}, we conclude that
    %
    \[ 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_M R^{d-2} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \Big( u 2^{l} 2^{(k-k')(d-1)} \Big) \Big( 2^{-k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{-lM} \Big). \]
    %
    Picking $M > 1$, we can sum over $k' + 10 \leq l \leq k - 5$, $\log_2(u) \lesssim k' \leq k - 10$, and $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k$ to find
    %
    \[ \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \sum_{k' \leq k - 10} \sum_{k'+10 \leq l \leq k - 5} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k (d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]

    \item Now let's estimate the interactions between the functions ${S\!}_{x_0,t_0}$ and ${S\!}_{x_1,t_1}$ with $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}$, for $k + 10 \leq l \leq \log_2 R$, then $x_1$ must lie in a geodesic ball of radius $O(2^l/R)$ centered at $x_0$. Such a ball is covered by $O( 2^{(l-k')d} )$ balls of radius $2^{k'}/R$, and the density of $\mathcal{E}_{k'}$ implies that
    %
    \[ \# \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim Ru\; 2^{(l-k')d} (2^{k'}/R) = u 2^{(l-k')d} 2^{k'}. \]
    %
    Together with Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma}, we conclude that
    %
    \[ 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_M R^{d-2} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \Big( u 2^{(l-k')d} 2^{k'} \Big) \Big( 2^{-lM} \Big). \]
    %
    Picking $M > d$, we can sum over $k - 5 \leq l \lesssim \log R$, $\log_2(u) \lesssim k' \leq k - 10$, and $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k$ to conclude that
    %
    \[ 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} 2^{k' \frac{d-1}{2}} \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_k} \sum_{k' \leq k - 10} \sum_{k-5 \leq l \lesssim \log R} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{G}_{x_0,t_0,l}} R^{d-2} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim R^{d-2}. \]
\end{itemize}
%
Putting these three bounds together, we conclude that
%
\[ \sum_{\log_2(u) \lesssim k' < k} |\langle F_k, F_{k'} \rangle| \lesssim R^{d-2} \sum_k 2^{k (d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
In particular, we have
%
\[ \| F \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim \log_2(u) \left( \sum_k \| F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 + R^{d-2} \sum_k 2^{k (d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k \right). \]
%
Next, let us fix some parameter $a$, and decompose $[2^k/R, 2^{k+1}/R]$ into the disjoint union of length $u^a$ intervals
%
\[ I_{k,\mu} = [ 2^k / R + (\mu - 1) u^a / R, 2^k / R + \mu u^a / R] \quad\text{for $1 \leq \mu \leq 2^k/u^a$}, \]
%
and thus considering a further decomposition $\mathcal{E}_k = \bigcup \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}$ and $F_k = \sum F_{k,\mu}$. As before, increasing the implicit constant in the Lemma, we may assume without loss of generality that the set $\{ \mu: \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu} \neq \emptyset \}$ is $10$-separated. We now estimate
%
\[ \sum_{\mu \geq \mu' + 10} |\langle F_{k,\mu}, F_{k,\mu'} \rangle|. \]
%
For $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}$ and $l \geq 1$, define
%
\[ \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l} = \left\{ (x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu'} : \max(d_g(x_0,x_1), t_0 - t_1) \sim 2^l u^a / R \right\}. \]
%
Then $\bigcup_{l \geq 1} \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ covers $\bigcup_{\mu \geq \mu' + 10} \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu'}$. The density properties of $\mathcal{E}_{k,\mu'}$ imply that provided that $l \leq k - a \log_2 u + 10$ (so that $2^l u^a / R \leq 2^k / R$),
%
\[ \# \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim (R u) (2^l u^a / R) = u^{a+1} 2^l \]
%
For $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$, we claim that
%
\[ 2^{k(d-1)} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k(d-1)} (2^l u^a)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}. \]
%
Indeed, for such tuples we have
%
\[ d_g(x_0,x_1) \gtrsim 2^l u^a / R \quad\text{or}\quad |d_g(x_0,x_1) - (t_0 - t_1)| \gtrsim 2^l u^a / R, \]
%
and the estimate follows from Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma} in either case. Since $d \geq 4$,
%
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{1 \leq l \leq k - a \log_2 u + 10} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}} 2^{k(d-1)} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| &\lesssim R^{d-2} \sum_{1 \leq l \leq k - a \log_2 u + 10} (2^{k(d-1)}) (2^l u^a)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} (u^{a+1} 2^l)\\
    &\lesssim R^{d-2} \sum_{1 \leq l \leq k - a \log_2 u + 10} 2^{k(d-1)} 2^{-l \frac{d-3}{2}} u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)}\\
    &\lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k(d-1)} u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)}.
\end{align*}
%
For $l > k - a \log_2 u + 10$, a tuple $(x_1,t_1)$ lies in $\mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ if and only if $d_g(x_0,x_1) \sim 2^l u^a / R$, since we always have
%
\[ |t_0 - t_1| \lesssim 2^k / R \ll 2^l u^a / R. \]
%
We conclude from Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma} that
%
\[ 2^{k(d-1)} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_M R^{d-2} 2^{k(d-1)} (2^l u^a)^{- M}. \]
%
Now $\mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ is covered by $O( (2^{l-k} u^a)^d )$ balls of radius $2^k / R$, and the density properties of $\mathcal{E}_k$ imply that
%
\[ \# \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim (Ru) (2^{l-k} u^a)^d ( 2^k / R ) \lesssim u^{1 + ad} 2^{ld} 2^{-k(d-1)}. \]
%
Thus, picking $M > \max(d,1+ad)$, we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{l \geq k - a \log_2 u + 10} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}} 2^{k(d-1)} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| &\lesssim R^{d-2} \sum_{l \geq k - a \log_2 u + 10} (2^{k(d-1)}) (2^l u^a)^{-M} u^{1 + ad} 2^{ld} 2^{-k(d-1)}\\
    &\lesssim R^{d-2}.
\end{align*}
%
Putting these two bounds together, and then summing over the tuples $(x_0,t_0)$, we conclude that
%
\[ \sum_{\mu \geq \mu' + 10} |\langle F_{k,\mu}, F_{k,\mu'} \rangle| \lesssim R^{d-2} \left( 1 + 2^{k(d-1)} u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} \right) \# \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}. \]
%
Now summing in $\mu$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim \sum_\mu \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 + R^{d-2} \left( 1 + 2^{k(d-1)} u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} \right) \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
\begin{comment}

But this means that
%
\[ \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim (2^l u^a)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} (u^{a+1} 2^l) = u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} 2^{- l \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)}. \]
%
Since $d \geq 4$, we can sum to conclude that
%
\[ \sum_{1 \leq l \leq k - a \log_2 u} \]
Summing over $1 \leq l \leq k - a \log_2 u$, 

\[ \lesssim \frac{1}{(R d_g(x_0,x_1))^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \langle R | d_g(x_0,x_1) - (t_0 - t_1) | \rangle^{-M} \]


 and $0 \leq l \lesssim R u^{-a}$, define
%
\[ \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l} = \left\{ (x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu'} : l(u^a / R) \leq d_g(x_0,x_1) \leq (l+1)(u^a/R) \right\}. \]
%
Note that for $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}$ and $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu'}$, $t_0 - t_1$ lies in a radius $O(u^a / R)$ interval centered at $(\mu - \mu') (u^a / R)$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $0 \leq l \leq (\mu - \mu') / 2$, if $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$, then $x_1$ lies in a thickness $O(u^a / R)$, radius $l (u^a / R)$ geodesic annulus centered at $x_0$. Thus $\mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ is covered by $O( \langle l \rangle ^{d-1})$ balls of radius $u^a / R$. Note that we incurred the logarithmic error in $u$ so that we can assume $u^a \leq 2^k$, so that the density properties of $\mathcal{E}_k$ imply that
    %
    \[ \# \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim (Ru) \langle l^{d-1} \rangle (u^a / R) = u^{a+1} \langle l \rangle^{d-1}. \]
    % We use the logaorithmic error to get u^a <= 2^k
    %
    Together with Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma}, we conclude that
    %
    \[ \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_M ( u^{a+1} \langle l \rangle^{d-1} ) \left( \langle l u^a \rangle^{- \frac{d-1}{2}} \left( (\mu - \mu') u^a \right)^{-M} \right). \]
    %
    Picking $M \gtrsim d$ and summing over $0 \leq l \leq (\mu - \mu') / 2$, $\mu' \leq \mu - 10$, and $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}$ gives that
    %
    \[ \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}} \sum_{\mu' \leq \mu - 10} \sum_{0 \leq l \leq (\mu - \mu') / 2} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}'} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim \# \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}. \]

    \item For $(\mu - \mu') / 2 \leq l \leq 2 (\mu - \mu')$, if $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$, then $x_1$ lies in a thickness $O(u^a / R)$, radius $O((\mu - \mu') (u^a / R))$ geodesic annulus centered at $x_0$. Thus $\mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ is covered by $O( (\mu - \mu')^{d-1} )$ balls of radius $u^a / R$. The density properties of $\mathcal{E}_k$ imply that
    %
    \[ \# \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_,l} \lesssim Ru (\mu - \mu')^{d-1} (u^a/R) = u^{a+1} (\mu - \mu')^{d-1}. \]

        &\quad\quad = u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} (\mu - \mu')^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \langle (l - (\mu - \mu')) u^a \rangle^{-M}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Picking $M \gtrsim d$ and summing over $(\mu - \mu') / 2 \leq l \leq 2 (\mu - \mu')$, $\mu' \leq \mu - 10$, and $(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}$ gives that
    %
    \[ \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}} \sum_{\mu' \leq \mu - 10} \sum_{(\mu - \mu')/2 \leq l \leq 2(\mu - \mu')} \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}'} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} \mu^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \# \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}. \]

    \item For $l > 2(\mu - \mu')$, if $(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$, then $x_1$ lies in a geodesic annulus with thickness $O(u^a/R)$ and radius $\gtrsim l u^a / R$, centered at $x_0$. Thus $\mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}$ is covered by $O(l^{d-1})$ balls of radius $u^a / R$. The density properties of $\mathcal{E}_k$ imply that
    %
    \[ \# \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l} \lesssim (Ru) l^{d-1} (u^a/R) = u^{a+1} l^{d-1}. \]
    %
    Together with Lemma \ref{mainOrthogonalityLemma}, we conclude that
    %
    \[ \sum_{(x_1,t_1) \in \mathcal{H}_{x_0,t_0,l}} |\langle {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, {S\!}_{x_1,t_1} \rangle| \lesssim_M (u^{a+1} l^{d-1}) (l u^a)^{-M}. \]

\end{itemize}
%
Thus we have, using that $\mu \lesssim 2^k / u^a$, we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 &\lesssim \sum_\mu \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 + \sum_\mu \left( 1 + u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} \mu^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \right) \# \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}\\
    &= \sum_\mu \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 + \left( 1 + 2^{k \frac{d+1}{2}} u^{1 - a (d-1)} \right) \# \mathcal{E}_k.
\end{align*}
%
\end{comment}
The functions in the sum defining $F_{k,\mu}$ are highly coupled, and it is difficult to use anything except Cauchy-Schwartz to break them apart. Since $\# ( \mathcal{T} \cap I_{k,\mu}) \sim u^a$, if we set $F_{k,\mu} = \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T} \cap I_{k,\mu}} F_{k,\mu,t}$, then we find
%
\[ \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim u^a \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T} \cap I_{k,\mu}} \| F_{k,\mu,t} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2. \]
%
Fortunately, since $\mathcal{X}$ is 1-separated, the functions in $F_{k,\mu,t}$ are quite orthogonal to one another, and so
%
\[ \| F_{k,\mu,t} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k(d-1)} \# (\mathcal{E}_k \cap (S^d \times \{ t \})). \]
%
But this means that
%
\[ u^a \sum_t \| F_{k,\mu,t} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k(d-1)} u^a \# \mathcal{E}_{k,\mu}. \]
%
and so
%
\begin{align*}
    \| F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 &\lesssim \sum_\mu \| F_{k,\mu} \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 + R^{d-2} \left( 1 + 2^{k(d-1)} u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} \right) \# \mathcal{E}_k\\
    &\lesssim R^{d-2} \left( 2^{k(d-1)} u^a + (1 + 2^{k(d-1)} u^{1 - a \left( \frac{d-3}{2} \right)} \right) \# \mathcal{E}_k.
\end{align*}
% u^a = u^{1 - a(d-3)/2}
% a ( (d-1)/2 ) = 1
%
Picking $a = 2 / (d-1)$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| F_k \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim R^{d-2} 2^{k(d-1)} u^{\frac{2}{d-1}} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
Thus, returning to our bound for $F$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| F \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim R^{d-2} \log_2(u) u^{\frac{2}{d-1}} \sum_k  2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]  
%
This completes the proof of the $L^2$ density bound.

We now return to a general index set $\mathcal{E} = \bigcup_k \mathcal{E}_k$. Using a density decomposition argument, we can write $\mathcal{E}_k = \bigcup_m \mathcal{E}_{k,m}$, where for each $k$ and $m$, $\mathcal{E}_{k,m}$ has density type $(R2^m, 2^k / R )$, and there exists a family of balls $\{ B_j \}$ covering $\mathcal{E}_{k,m}$, with $\text{rad}(B_j) = r_j$, such that $\sup_j r_j \leq 2^k / R$, and $\sum_j r_j \leq \# \mathcal{E}_k / R 2^m$. Define
%
\[ F^m = \sum_k \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,m}} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}. \]
%
We have $\# \mathcal{E}_{k,m} \leq \# \mathcal{E}_k$ for each $m$, and so the density bound above implies
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim R^{d-2} m\; 2^{\frac{2m}{d-1}} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
For $p \ll 1$, we can exploit the fact that the points in $\mathcal{E}_{k,m}$ are highly concentrated for large $m$ to get better bounds, which we will then interpolate.

A similar analysis (TODO: Move to previous section) justifies that
%
\[ {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}(x) \leq \frac{R^{d-1}}{( R d_g(x,x_0) )^{\frac{d-1}{2}}} \Big\langle R \big| t_0 - d_g(x,x_0) \big| \Big\rangle^{-M}. \]
%
Thus the function is concentrated on the radius $t_0$, thickness $1/R$ geodesic annulus centered at $x_0$, and on this annulus, the function has height $R^{d-1} (R t_0)^{- \frac{d-1}{2}}$. If we consider a ball $B_j$ with radius $r_j$, and center $x_j$, and consider the function
%
\[ F^m_{k,j} = \sum_k \sum_{(x_0,t_0) \in \mathcal{E}_{k,m} \cap B_j} 2^{k \frac{d-1}{2}} {S\!}_{x_0,t_0}, \]
%
then the $F^m_{k,j}$ is concentrated on a geodesic annulus with radius $\sim 2^k / R$ and thickness $r_j$, centered at $x_j$. By the density properties, $\# ( \mathcal{E}_{k,m} \cap B_j ) \leq 2^m R r_j$, and so $F^m_{k,j}$ has height $O(R^d 2^m r_j)$ on this annulus. We thus conclude that
%
% The measure is (2^k / R)^{d-1} r_j
%
\[ \| F^m_{k,j} \|_{L^\varepsilon(S^d)}^\varepsilon \lesssim \left( ( 2^k / R )^{d-1} r_j \right) \left( 2^m r_j \right)^\varepsilon \lesssim 2^{k(d-1)} R^{-(d-1-\varepsilon)} 2^{m\varepsilon} r_j. \]
%
For $\varepsilon < 1$, we can sum in $j$ and $k$, using the concentrating properties to conclude that
%
\[ \| F^m_k \|_{L^\varepsilon(S^d)}^\varepsilon \lesssim 2^{-m(1-\varepsilon)} 2^{k(d-1)} R^{-(d - \varepsilon)} \# \mathcal{E}_k \]
%
and thus
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^\varepsilon(S^d)}^\varepsilon \lesssim R^{-(d-\varepsilon)} 2^{-m(1 - \varepsilon)} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
TODO

So we now have two bounds, namely
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^2(S^d)}^2 \lesssim m\; 2^{\frac{2m}{d-1}} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k \]
%
and
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^\varepsilon(S^d)}^\varepsilon \lesssim R^{-(d-\varepsilon)} 2^{-m(1 - \varepsilon)} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
Can we now interpolate these two bounds? If $1/p = t/\varepsilon + (1 - t)/2$, then
%
\[ t = \frac{1/p - 1/2}{1/\varepsilon - 1/2}. \]
%
and we should expect to get
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^p(S^d)}^p \lesssim \left( R^{-(d - \varepsilon)} 2^{-m(1 - \varepsilon)} \right)^t \left( m 2^{\frac{2m}{d-1}} \right)^{1 - t} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
As long as $d \geq 2$, we can choose $\varepsilon = 2^{1/2} (d-1)^{-1/2} (1/p - 1/2)^{-1/2}$, which yields
%
\[ \| F^m \|_{L^p(S^d)}^p \lesssim R^{-(d - \varepsilon)} m 2^{-\delta_{p,d} m} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k. \]
%
Summing in $m$ thus gives that
%
\[ \| F \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \left( R^{-(d - \varepsilon)} \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)} \# \mathcal{E}_k \right)^{1/p} \]
% -(1 - epsilon) t + 2(1-t)/(d-1) < 0
% 2 (1/epsilon - 1/2)(1 - t)/(d-1) < (1 - epsilon)(1/p - 1/2) 
% 2 (1/epsilon - 1/p) < (1-epsilon) (d-1) (1/p - 1/2)
% 2/eps - 2/p + eps (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) < (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)
% 2/eps + eps (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) < (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) + 2/p
%
% Choosing 2/e = e(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)
%          e = sqrt(2/(d-1)(1/p - 1/2))
% We get a condition that
%
% sqrt( 2 (d-1) (1/p - 1/2) ) < (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) + 2/p

It finally remains to analyze the operator $II_R \circ Q$, where
%
\[ II_R = \int b_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \] % \quad\text{and} Q_{II,R} = \int c_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
obtained by integrating the wave propogators over times $50/R \leq |t| \leq 1/100$, with
%
\[ b_R(t) = \chi_{II,R}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt). \] % \quad\text{and}\quad c_R(t) = \chi_{II,R}(t) R \widehat{\beta}(Rt). \]
%
This will take the bulk of our analysis, and to prevent notation from becoming too cumbersome later on, let us write us eschew the subscript $R$ for now, writing the operator as
%
\[ II = \int b(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt. \]
%
Essentially, we know the following facts about the function $b$:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\| b \cdot t^{\alpha_p} \|_{L^p(\RR)} \lesssim (1/R)^{\alpha_p - 1/p^*} C_p(h)$.
    % b_R(t) = chi_{II,R}(t) R h^(Rt)
    % b_R(s/R) / R = chi_{II,R}(s/R) h^(s)      IE on R >> s >> 1
    % R^{-1} ( int [ t^{s_p} b_R(t/R) ]^p )^{1/p}  << C_p(h)
    % R^{s_p - 1/p^*} (  int  [ t^{s_p} b_R(t) ]^p )^{1/p} << C_p(h)

    \item $\text{supp}(b) \subset \{ 50/R \leq |t| \leq 2/5 \}$.

    \item We have
    %
    \[ \widehat{b}(\tau) = \int \widehat{\chi}_{II}(\tau') \cdot h \left( \frac{\tau - \tau'}{R} \right)\; d\tau', \]
    % This integral is O_N(  < tau / R >^{-N} )
    %
    so the Fourier support of $b$ is concentrated on a ball of radius $O(R)$ about the origin, i.e.
    %
    \[ |\widehat{b}(\tau)| \lesssim_N \langle \tau / R \rangle^{-N}. \]
    %
    Uncertainty principle heuristics thus imply that we should expect $b$ to be locally constant at a scale $1/R$. If we let $\mathcal{T}$ be all points in the lattice $(1/10R) \ZZ$ lying in the set $\{ 1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim 1 \}$, and for each $t_0 \in \mathcal{T}$, write
    %
    \[ \chi_{II} = \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{T}} \chi_{t_0}, \]
    %
    where for each $t_0 \in \mathcal{T}$, $\chi_{t_0}$ is smooth and adapted to the sidelength $1/R$ interval centered at $t_0$, i.e. satisfying estimates of the form
    %
    \[ | (\partial_t^\alpha \chi_{t_0})(t) | \lesssim_\alpha R^{- \alpha}. \]
    %
    We can thus decompose $b = \sum b_{t_0}$, where
    %
    \[ b_{t_0}(t) = \chi_{t_0}(t) R \widehat{h}(Rt). \]
    %
    For such a decomposition, we still have estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |\widehat{b}_{t_0}(\tau)| \lesssim_N \langle \tau / R \rangle^{-N}, \]
    %
    so we should still think of $\widehat{b}_{t_0}$ as being Fourier localized to frequencies lying in the ball of radius $O(R)$ about the origin.

%TODO: Maybe can be more efficient for $t_0 \gg 1/R$ given that $\chi_{II}$ is more smooth near this value, i.e. $\chi_{II}$ is concentrated in phase space on the union of the rectangles $\{ |t| \lesssim 1/R \} \times \{ |\tau| \lesssim R \}$ and the rectangle $\{ 1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim 1 \} \times \{ |\tau| \lesssim 1 \}$.

%    \item Uncertainty principle heuristics tell us that, since the Fourier transform of $b$ has the majority of it's mass supported on a ball of radius $O(R)$, $b_R$ should be, heuristically speaking, locally constant at a scale $1/R$. If $\mathcal{T}$ is a maximal $1/R$ separated subset of $[50/R, 2/3]$, and we can find a smooth family of functions $\{ \eta_{R,t} : t \in \mathcal{T} \}$ adapted to the family of length $(2/3)(1/R)$ intervals with centers in $\mathcal{T}$, and constants $\{ c(t) \}$ such that
    %
%    \[ b = \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} c(t) \eta_t, \]
    %
%    The $L^p$ bound for $b$ is then equivalent to the fact that
    %
%    \[ \| c(t) \cdot t^{s_p} \|_{l^p_t(\mathcal{T}_R)} \lesssim C_p(h) R^{1 - s_p}. \]
    %
%    For $t_0 \in \mathcal{T}$, we define
    %
%    \[ II_{t_0} = \int \eta_{t_0}(t) \cos(2 \pi t P)\; dt \]
\end{itemize}
%
The boundedness of $II$ reduces to proving estimates of the form
%
\[ \| II f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \leq R^{\alpha_p - 1/p^*} \| b \cdot t^{\alpha_p} \|_{L^p} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \]
%
for all functions $f \in V_R$. Given the presence of the $L^p$ norm of $b_R$ and the $L^{p^*}$ norm of $f$, a natural first choice might be to try and prove this inequality using H\"{o}lder's inequality, writing
% R^{-s_p} R^{1/p-s_p}
\begin{align*}
    \| II f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} &= \left\| \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} c(t) II_t f \right\|_{L^{p^*}(M)}\\
    &\lesssim \| c \cdot t^{\alpha_p} \|_{l^p_t(\mathcal{T})} \| II_t \cdot t^{- \alpha_p} \|_{L^{p^*}(M) l^{p^*}_t(\mathcal{T})}\\
    &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{1 - \alpha_p} \| II_t f \cdot t^{-\alpha_p} \|_{L^{p^*}(M) l^{p^*}_t(\mathcal{T})}.
\end{align*}
%
Our proof \emph{would} be complete if we could show that
%
\[ \| II_{R,t} f \cdot t^{-\alpha_p} \|_{L^{p^*}(M) l^{p^*}_t(\mathcal{T}_R)} \lesssim R^{\alpha_p - 1} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}. \]
%
However, this is \emph{not} a valid inequality\footnote{TODO: I thought I'd found a counterexample before using periodicity, but I made a mistake, which means the counterexample doesn't quite work. Maybe a sum of different annuli will work, at least to get a logarithmic counterexample?}. We therefore \emph{cannot} naively H\"{o}lder out the function $b$, and so we must use additional orthogonality properties of the wave equation to obtain the required result.
% Take f = sum c_r f_r, where f_r is constant on an annulus of radius r +/- 1/R
% Then |f|_{p^*} = ( sum |c_r|^{p^*} r^{d-1} )^{1/p^*} / R^{1/p^*}
% Then in a O(1/R) bal at the origin, | II_{R,t} f t^{-s_p} |_{l^{p^*}} = ( sum |c_r|^{p^*}  r^{-s_p} )^{1/p^*}

\end{comment}

\begin{comment}

Using periodicity, if $R$ is divisible by $1/2$, then we can write
%
\begin{align*}
    &\int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \leq 1/2} \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|^{p^*}_{L^{p^*}(M)}\\
    &\quad \approx \frac{1}{2R} \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim R} \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*}\; dt - (1 - 1/2R) \int_{|t| \lesssim 1/R} \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*}\; dt.
\end{align*}
% 2R - 1 copies of |t| <= 1/R
%
The first term is just a rescaled local smoothing term. If $f$ is badly behaved, we can therefore expect to have
%
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{2R} \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim R} \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*}\; dt &\approx R^{s_{p^*} p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*}\\
    &= R^{(d-1)(p^*/2 - 1) - 1} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*}
\end{align*}
%
whereas we should also expect by pseudolocal finite speed of propogation and the intuitive local constancy of $f$ on scales $1/R$ that
%
\begin{align*}
    \int_{|t| \lesssim 1/R} |e^{2 \pi i t P} f|^{p^*}\; dt &\approx \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*}.
\end{align*}
%
Thus in the range of $p^*$ we are considering, the first term has much larger $L^p$ norm, and thus cannot be cancelled out by subtracting the second term. We thus conclude that in the worst case, we should expect
%
\[ \left( \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \leq 1/2} \| e^{2 \pi i t P} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \gtrsim R^{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*) - 1/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}. \]

One tool to obtain more detailed information about the operator $II$ is to introduce the Hadamard parametrix, which produces, for any $N > 0$ on $S^{d-1}$, a smooth family of distributions on $S^{d-1}$ given by
%
\[ \{ W(t,y): t \in I, y \in S^{d-1} \}, \]
% N = 100 d
such that there exists %$A \in C^\infty(S^{d-1} \times I \times S^{d-1})$ and
smooth functions $a_{k,\pm} \in C^\infty(S^{d-1} \times I \times S^{d-1})$ such that
%
\[ \text{supp}(a_{k,\pm}) \subset \{ (x,t,y) : d_g(x,y) \leq t \}, \]
%
and $W(t,y) = \sum_{k,\pm} a_{k,\pm} W_{k,\pm}(t,y)$, where $0 \leq k \leq 2N$, and
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle W_k(t,y), \phi \rangle &= \int_B \int_{\RR^d} \phi( \exp_y x ) \frac{\chi(\xi)}{|\xi|^k} e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot x \pm t |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dx,
    % \int_{S^{d-1}} A(x,t,y) \phi(x) dV(x)
\end{align*}
%
where $\chi$ is smooth, equal to zero for $|\xi| \leq 5$, and equal to one for $|\xi| \geq 10$. This distribution has the property that if we consider the resulting Schwartz operators $T_t$ from $S^{d-1}$ to $S^{d-1} \times I$ with Schwartz kernel $W(t,y)\; dV(y)$, then $\cos(2 \pi t P) - T_t$ is a Fourier integral operator of order $-N$, associated with the canonical relation given by the light cone on $S^{d-1}$.
% partial_t E_N has
%      symbol of order - N
%      phase variable is d dimensional
%      For a fixed t, distribution is defined on a d dimensional space.
% Thus E_N is an FIO of order - N - d/4 + d/2 = - N + d/4
% E_N is given by an oscillatory integral against a symbol of order N + 1, and where the phase variable is d dimensional.

% Time derivative of distribution of order N - (d-1)/2
% Im( |x|^2 + (t + i0)^2 )^{N - (d-1)/2}

Fix $\nu \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ supported on $\{ C^{-1} \leq |\xi| \leq C \}$, and equal to one on $\{ (C/2)^{-1} \leq |\xi| \leq (C/2) \}$. Define distributions $\tilde{W}_k(t,y)$ by setting
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle \tilde{W}_k(t,y), \phi \rangle &= \int_B \int_{\RR^d} \eta( \xi / R ) \phi( \exp_y x ) \frac{\chi(\xi)}{|\xi|^k} e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot x \pm t |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dx\\
    &= R^{d - k} \int_B \int_{\RR^d} \phi( \exp_y x) \frac{\eta(\xi)}{|\xi|^k} e^{2 \pi i R ( \xi \cdot x \pm t |\xi| )}\; d\xi\; dx.
\end{align*}
%
Then let $H_k(t)$ be the Schwartz operator with kernel equal to $\tilde{W}_k(t,y)\; dV(y)$. Let's analyze the operators
%
\[ II_k f(x) = \int b(t) H_k(t)\; dt. \]
%
We may write $II_k = \sum c(t_0) II_{k,t_0}$, where
%
\[ II_{k,t_0} = \int \eta_{t_0}(t) H_k(t)\; dt. \]
%
Suppose we can write
%
\[ f = \sum_{y_0 \in \mathcal{X}} a(y_0) \phi_{y_0}, \]
%
where $\mathcal{X}$ is a maximal, $1/R$ separated subset of $S^{d-1}$, and $\{ \phi_{y_0} \}$ is a smooth family of functions adapted to $(2/3) (1/R)$ radius balls about the points $\{ y_0 \}$.

For each $y_0$, the principle of nonstationary phase (integrating by parts sufficiently many times) implies that $II_{k,t_0} \phi_{y_0}$ has the majority of it's support concentrated on a $O(1/R)$ neighborhood of a radius $t_0$ sphere about the point $y_0$, i.e. for any $M \geq 0$, with $|d_g(y,y_0) - t_0| \geq 10 / R$,
%
\[ |(II_{k,t_0} \phi_{y_0})(y)| \lesssim_M R^{-1-d-M} |d_g(y,y_0) - t_0|^{-M}. \]
%
On the other hand, for $|d_g(y_0,y_1) - t_0| \leq 1/R$, with $y_1 = \exp_{y_0}(\mp t_1 \xi_1)$ for some $t_1$ with $|t_1 - t_0| \leq 1/R$, and $|\xi_1| = 1$, then $\phi_{y_1} II_{k,t_0} \phi_{y_0}$ has Fourier support concentrated on a $1/R \times 1$ tube through the origin pointing in the direction $\xi_1$,
%
\begin{align*}
    R^{d-k} & \int \int_{S^{d-1}} \int_B \int_{\RR^d} \eta_{t_0}(t) \phi_{y_0}(y) \phi_{y_1}( \exp_y x ) \frac{\eta(\xi)}{|\xi|^k} e^{2 \pi i R (\xi \cdot x \pm t |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dx\; dV(y)\; dt\\
    &\quad = s
\end{align*}
% Should have Fourier concentration at xi


% partial_{j,k} { t sqrt(sum xi_i^2)^{1/2} }
%   = t xi_k sqrt( sum xi_i^2 )^{-1/2}
%   = t [delta_{j,k} sqrt( sum xi_i^2 )^{-1/2} - xi_k xi_j sqrt( sum xi_i^2 )^{-3/2}]
\[ \int (II_{k,t_0} \phi_{y_0})(y) \phi_{y_1}(y) \]
\[ II_{k,t_0} \phi_{y_0}(y) = R^{d-k} \eta(\xi_0) \]

 integration by parts shows that $II_{k,t_0} f$ is supported on a 

$\delta + O(t_0)$
%
\[ \int_{|d_g(x,x_0) - t_0| \gtrsim 1/R} (II_{k,t_0} f)(x) \]

We note that non-stationary phase gives that for $x,y \in S^{d-1}$,
%
\[ \| II_{k,t_0}(x,y) \|_{L^1} \]

for $||d_g(x,y)| - t| = t_0 \pm 1/R$

 applies to the oscillatory integral defining the distribution $H_k(t)(x,y)$ has  for $d_g(x,y)$
% x = t xi / |xi| = 0

a series of smooth functions $\{ \alpha_{\nu,j,k}: S^{d-1} \times \RR \times S^{d-1} \to  \}$

One thing that will help us obtain more detailed information about the operator we are studying is the introduction of the Lax Parametrix for the wave equation, which is valid because we are analyzing the wave equation over a small set of times. Recall that for $|t| \lesssim 1$, we can consider a finite sum
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t P} = A_t + \sum_{W \in \mathcal{W}} W_t, \]
%
where $\{ A_t \}$ are a smooth family of smoothing operators, i.e. there exists $\alpha \in C^\infty(\RR \times M \times M)$ such that
%
\[ A_t f(x) = \int_{S^d} \alpha(t,x,y) f(y)\; dy \]
%
for any $f \in C^\infty(M)$. The operators $\{ W_t \}$ satisfy the following properties:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each $W \in \mathcal{W}$, we can find a compact set $X$ of $\RR^d$, contained in an open subset $\Omega$ of $\RR^d$, and a diffeomorphism $G: \Omega \to S^d$, such that the operators $\{ W_t \}$ are all supported on $G(X)$, in the sense that any $f \in C^\infty(M)$, $\text{supp}(Wf) \subset G(X)$, and if $\text{supp}(f) \cap G(X) = \emptyset$, $Wf = 0$.

    \item In coordinates, the operator has a Schwartz kernel represented by an oscillatory integral. More precisely, for $f \in C^\infty(M)$, and $x \in X$, we can write
    %
    \[ W_t f(G(x)) = \int_\Omega \int_{\RR^d} a(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i[ \phi(x,y,\eta) + t p(y,\eta) ]} f(G(y)) \; d\eta\; dy, \]
    %
    where
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The function $\phi$ is smooth away from $\eta = 0$, homogeneous of degree one, and satisfies $\phi(x,y,\eta) \approx (x - y) \cdot \eta$, in the sense that
        %
        \[ |\partial^\beta_\eta \{ \phi(x,y,\eta) - (x - y) \cdot \eta \}| \lesssim_\beta |x - y|^2 |\eta|^{1-\beta}. \]
        %
        We recall that $p$ is the principal symbol of $P$.

        \item The amplitude function $a$ is a symbol of order zero with
        %
        \[ \text{supp}(a) \subset \{ (x,y,\eta,t) \in K \times K \times \RR^d \times \RR: |x - y| \lesssim 1\ \text{and}\ |\eta| \gtrsim 1 \}, \]
        %
        In particular, we may choose $\text{supp}_{(x,y)} (a)$ to be close enough to the diagonal that one has
        %
        \[ |\nabla_\eta \phi(x,y,\eta)| \gtrsim |x - y| \quad\text{and}\quad |\nabla_x \phi(x,y,\eta)| \gtrsim |\eta| \]
        %
        on the support of $a$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%
It follows that we can write
%
\[ II_R = II_{A,R} + \sum_{W \in \mathcal{W}} II_{W,R}, \]
%
where for $S \in \{ A, W \}$,
%
\[ II_{S,R} = \int b_R(t) S_t \; dt. \]
%
Since this is a finite sum, it suffices to bound each of these operators separately, uniformly in $R$.

\end{comment}

\begin{comment}

To help understand this orthogonality, we consider the Lax Parametrix $T_W$, an operator whose kernel is a finite sum of Fourier integrals, such that
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t P} = T_W + T_A, \]
%
where $T_A$ is a smoothing operator. Let us use this decomposition to write $II = II_A + II_W$,
%
\[ II_A = \int b(t) T_A\; dt \quad\text{and}\quad II_W = \int b(t) T_W\; dt. \]
%
We will bound each of these terms individually.

\begin{lemma}
    We have
    %
    \[ \| II_A f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniform in $R$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $K$ denote the kernel of $II_A$, i.e. so we have
    %
    \[ K(x,y) = \int b(t) A(t,x,y)\; dy. \]
    %
    Then H\"{o}lder's inequality, combined with the fact that $b$ is supported on the interval $I = \{ 50/R \leq |t| \leq 2/5 \}$ implies that
    %   
    \begin{align*}
        \| K \|_{L^\infty_x L^\infty_y} &\lesssim \| b \cdot t^{s_p} \|_{L^p_t(I)} \| A \cdot t^{-s_p} \|_{L^{p^*}_t(I)}\\
        &\lesssim \left[ (1/R)^{s_p - 1/p^*} C_p(h) \right] \left[ R^{s_p - 1/p^*} \right] \lesssim C_p(h).
    \end{align*}
    %
    Applying Schur's Lemma, we conclude that $II_A$ is bounded from $L^1(M)$ to $L^\infty(M)$, and $L^\infty(M)$ to $L^1(M)$, with operator norm bounded by a constant multiple of $C_p(h)$, independent of $R$. Interpolation completes the proof.
\end{proof}

The operator $II_W$ proves more tricky to analyze. We will obtain some restricted bounds for this operator, so let us consider an analysis of functions of the form $S = II_W \{ E \}$, for some fixed measurable set $E \subset S^d$. We can cover $S^d$ by a finite family of coordinate charts $\{ \theta \}$, and break down $II_W$ into a finite sum $II_{W,\theta}$, where the kernel of $II_{W,\theta}$ has $x$ and $y$ support on a compact subset of $\theta$, and moreover, the pushforward operator $II_{W,\theta}^\theta$ on $\RR^d$ has a kernel $K_\theta$ which is defined by an oscillatory integral distribution
%
\[ K_\theta(x,y) = \int a_\theta(x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \varphi_\theta(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi_y|_{g(y)} ]}\; d\xi, \]
%
where the amplitude $a_\theta$ is a symbol of order zero, with compact $x$ and $y$ support, the phase $\varphi$ is smooth, and we have
%
\[ \varphi_\theta(x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi, \]
%
in the sense that
%
\[ |\partial_x^\alpha \partial_y^\beta \partial_\xi^\lambda \{ \varphi_\theta(x,y,\xi) - (x - y) \cdot \xi \}| \lesssim |x - y|^2 |\xi|^{2 - \lambda}, \]
%
and where $|\xi|_{g(y)} = (\sum g^{ij}(y) \xi_i \xi_j )^{1/2}$ gives the length of the covector $\xi$ with respect to the Riemannian metric $g$. Let us write $\phi_\theta$ for $\varphi_\theta + t |\xi|_g$. We make the simpliying assumption that $a_\theta$ is supported on $|\xi| \sim R$, and satisfies symbol derivative bounds independent of $R$ (TODO: Justify this).

Let us now consider a maximal $1/2R$ separated subset $\mathcal{X}$ of $M$, and break $E$ down into a disjoint union of sets $\{ E_{x_0}: x_0 \in \mathcal{X} \}$, where for $x_0 \in \mathcal{X}$, the set $E_{x_0}$ is supported on the geodesic ball of radius $1/R$ about $x_0$. If we now define
%
\[ \ess_{x_0,t_0}(x) = \int b_{t_0}(t) (T_W \circ Q_R) \{ E_{x_0} \}(x,t)\; dt, \]
%
then $S = \sum \ess_{x_0,t_0}$. We will begin by understanding the orthogonality properties of these functions in the decomposition of $S$.

Because the half-wave propagators satisfy the equations
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t P} \circ e^{2 \pi i t' P} = e^{2 \pi i (t + t') P} \quad\text{and}\quad (e^{2 \pi i t P})^* = e^{-2 \pi i t P}, \]
%
the same is true for the Lax parametrix $T_W$, \emph{modulo smoothing operators}. In other words, there are smooth functions $A_1(t,t',x,y)$ and $A_2(t,x,y)$ defining smoothing operators $T_{A_1}(t,t')$ and $T_{A_2}(t)$ such that
%
\[ T_W(t+t') - T_W(t) \circ T_W(t') = T_{A_1}(t,t') \quad\text{and}\quad T_W^*(t) - T_W(t) = T_{A_2}(t). \]
%
It thus follows that if we define $T_{A'}(t,t') = T_{A_2}(t') \circ T_W(t) + T_{A_1}(t,t')$, then
%
\[ T_W^*(t') \circ T_W(t) = T_W(-t') \circ T_W(t) + T_{A_2}(t,t') \circ T_W(t) = T_W(t-t') + T_{A'}(t,t'), \]
%
and so
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle \ess_{x_0,t_0}, \ess_{x_1,t_1} \rangle &= \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \Big\langle T_W(t) \{ E_{x_0} \}, T_W(t') \{ E_{x_1} \} \Big\rangle\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_W^*(t') \circ T_W(t) \{ E_{x_0} \}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \Big[ \langle T_W(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle + \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle \Big]\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int (b_{t_0} * \overline{b}_{t_1})(t) \langle T_W(t) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\\
    &\quad\quad+ \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt'.
\end{align*}
%
Write
%
\[ G_{x_0,x_1}(t,t') = \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle. \]
%
Then $G_{x_0,x_1}$ satisfies estimates of the form
%
\[ \Big| \partial_t^k \partial_{t'}^l G_{x_0,x_1} \Big| \lesssim_{k,l} 1 \]


\[ \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_{A'}(t,t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt' \]

%
Smoothness should guarantee that the term corresponding to $\langle T_R E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle$ is negligible, so we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \langle f_{x_0,t_0}, f_{x_1,t_1} \rangle &\approx \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b_{t_1}(t')} \langle T_W(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt\; dt'\\
    &= \int (b_{t_0} * b_{t_1}^*)(s) \langle T_W(s) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; ds.
\end{align*}
%
an integral supported for $s$ in a $O(1/R)$ neighborhood of $t_0-t_1$. Let us write $c_{t_0,t_1} = b_{t_0} * b_{t_1}^*$. We have good control over the $L^p$ norms of $b_{t_0}$ and $b_{t_1}$, and so by Young's inequality, we have good control over the $L^q$ norm of $c_{t_0,t_1}$, where $q = p/(2-p)$; As we get close to the optimal range, $q$ increases until it gets arbitrarily close to $d$. However, since $c_{t_0,t_1}$ has compact support, we can decrease $q$ as a tradeoff for powers of $R$, and we can increase $q$ as a tradeoff against powers of $R$ since $c_{t_0,t_1}$ has Fourier transform supported on a ball of radius $R$.

To further study this quantity, we have
%
\[ \langle T_W(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle = \sum_\theta \langle T_{W,\theta}(t-t') E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle, \ \langle T_W(t) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle\; dt + \int b_{t_0}(t) \overline{b}_{t_1}(t') \langle T_{A'} E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle \]
%
where $\theta$ ranges over all coordinate charts whose domains contain $E_{x_0}$ and $E_{x_1}$ (the other charts we may ignore, by the support properties of the operators making up the Lax parametrix).  If we let $E_{x_0}^\theta$ and $E_{x_0}^\theta$ denote the images of these two sets in the coordinate chart, then we can write
%
\[ \langle T_{W,\theta}(s) E_{x_0}, E_{x_1} \rangle = \int_{E_{x_0}^\theta} \int_{E_{x_1}^\theta} \int a_\theta(s,x,y,\xi) \chi(\xi / R) e^{2 \pi i \phi_\theta(s,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dx\; dy. \]
%
For each $y$, consider a smooth function $F_y$ defined on $\text{supp}_x a_\theta$, such that
%
\[ \exp_y(F_y^{-1}(x)) = x, \]
%
where $\exp_y$ is the geodesic flow emerging from $y$. If
%
\[ a'_\theta(s,z,y,\xi) = |\det(DF_y(z))| a_\theta(s,F_y(z),y,\xi), \]
%
then we can rewrite the oscillatory sum above as
%
\[ R^d \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \int a'_\theta(s,z,y,R \xi) \chi(\xi) e^{2 \pi i R \phi_\theta(s,F_y(z),y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dz\; dy. \]
%
Let us now perform a polar coordinate decomposition in $\xi$, i.e. writing $\xi = \rho \omega$, where $\rho = |\xi|_{g(y)}$ and $\omega$ ranges over $\Sigma_y$. Writing $\alpha(y,\omega) = \langle n(y,\omega), \omega \rangle$, then
%
\[ a''_\theta(s,z,y,\rho,\omega) = \alpha(y,\omega) a'_\theta(s,z,y,\rho \omega), \]
%
then we obtain that the sum is
%
\[ R^d \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \int \int \rho^{d-1} a''_\theta(s,z,y,R \rho, \omega) \chi(\rho \omega) e^{2 \pi i R \rho \phi_\theta(s,F_y(z),y,\omega)}\; d\omega\; d\rho\; dz\; dy. \]
%
Applying the principle of nonstationary phase in the $\omega$ variable, which for any value of $y$, $z$, and $\rho$, is only stationary when $\omega = z / |z|$, we conclude that there is a symbol $\tilde{a}_\theta$ of order $-(d-1)/2$ such that the oscillatory integral is
%
\[ R^d \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \int \rho^{d-1} \tilde{a}_\theta(s,z,y,R \rho) \chi(\rho) e^{2 \pi i R \rho (s + |z|)}\; ds\; dz\; dy. \]
%
Imagining that $\tilde{a}_\theta(s,z,y, R \rho) \approx \eta(s,z,y) (R \rho)^{-(d-1)/2}$, we conclude that the integral should behave like
%
\[ R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} \eta(s,z,y) (\partial^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \widehat{\chi})(R(s + |z|))\; dz\; dy \]
%
TODO: Integrate by parts in $z$ now? IS THE FACT THAT WE ABSORBED THE SYMBOL INTO $\eta$ BAD, i.e. so that differentiating in $z$ orthogonally behaves differently? If we now reintroduce the integral in time, we have to now analyze
%
\[ R^{\frac{d+1}{2}} \int \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} c_{t_0,t_1}(s) \eta(s,y,z) (\partial^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \widehat{\chi} )(R(s + |z|))\; dz\; dy\; ds. \]
%
TODO: Does integrating by parts in the $t$ and $t'$ variable do anything for us? Is this where we need oscillation. If $|t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1)| \geq 10/R$, then we conclude this quantity is
%
\begin{align*}
    & O_N \Big( R^{\frac{d+1}{2}-N} \int \int_{E_{x_0}} \int_{F_y^{-1}(E_{x_0})} |c_{t_0,t_1}(s)| |\eta(s,y,z)| (s + |z|)^{-N}\; dz\; dy\; ds \Big)\\
    &\quad\quad O_N \Big( R^{\frac{d+1}{2} - N} |t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1)|^{-N} |E_{x_0}| |E_{x_1}| \| c_{t_0,t_1} \|_{L^1} \Big)
\end{align*}
%
If $|E_{x_0}|$ and $|E_{x_1}|$ are both proportional to $1/R^d$, then this quantity is
%
\begin{align*}
    & O_N \Big( R^{-\frac{3d-1}{2} - N} |t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1)|^{-N} \| c_{t_0,t_1} \|_{L^1} \Big)\\
    &\quad = O_N \Big( R^{-\frac{3d-1}{2} - 1/p^* - N} (t_0 - t_1 + d_g(x_0,x_1))^{-N} \| b_{t_0} \|_{L^p} \| b_{t_1} \|_{L^p} \Big)\\
    &\quad = O_N \Big( t_0^{\alpha_p} t_1^{\alpha_p} R^{-\frac{3d-1}{2} - 1/p^* - N} (t_0 - t_1 + d_g(E_{x_0}, E_{x_1}))^{-N} \Big)
    % -3d/2 + 1/2 - N
    % s_p = (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)

% |c| << |c|_{L^q} R^{2(1/p-1)}







Our analysis will again apply our simplifying assumption that our inputs $f$ lie in the space $V_R$. In particular, for such $f$, we have $II_W \{ f \} = (II_W \circ Q_R) \{ f \}$. One consequence of this is that we can localize the amplitude in the oscillatory integral representation of the operator $II_W$ to be supported near where the phase-variable has magnitude $\Theta(R)$. More precisely, let $\upsilon \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ be supported on $\{ C^{-1} \leq |\eta| \leq C \}$, and equal to one on a slightly smaller neighborhood. Set $\upsilon_R(\eta) = \upsilon( \eta / R)$. Define the operators $T'_{W,t}$ to be the Schwartz operator with kernel $W'(t,\cdot,\cdot)$, where
%
\[ W'(t,x,y) = \int a(x,y,\eta,t) \upsilon_R(\eta) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(x,y,t,\eta) ]}\; d\eta, \]
%
and then define
%
\[ II'_W = \int b(t) T'_{W,t}\; dt. \]
%
For inputs lying in $V_R$, we claim that the behaviour of $II_W$ and $II_W$ differ by terms uniformly bounded in $R$, so that bounds for one operator automatically imply $L^p$ bounds on the other operator.

    But this quantity is $O( |x - y|^2 |\eta| )$

    Let $K$ denote the kernel of the operator in the coordinate system $G$, i.e. such that
    %
    \[ [(II_W - II_W') \circ Q_R] \{ f \}(G(x)) = \int K(x,y) f(G(y))\; dy. \]

    Fix a bump function $\beta$ supported on $\{ 1/4 \leq |t| \leq 4 \}$, and equal to one on $\{ 1/2 \leq |t| \leq 2 \}$. Then if $f \in V_R$, then $\beta(P/R) \{ f \} = f$. To understand the behaviour between $II_{W,R} - II_{V,R}$, it is therefore natural to do some calculations related to the kernel of the operator
    %
    \[ [II_{W,R} - II_{V,R}] \circ \beta(P/R). \]

\begin{comment}

\begin{lemma}
    For $f \in V_R$, we have
    %
    \[ \| (II_W - II'_W) f \|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(M)}, \]
    %
    where the implicit constant is uniform in $R$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Consider the pseudodifferential operators $\{ Q_R \}$ introduced in the proof that Theorem \ref{RestrictedMainSphereTheorem} implies Theorem \ref{MainSphereTheorem}. For $f \in V_R$, $Q_R f = f$, so to understand the behaviour of the difference $II_W - II_W'$, it is natural to study the operator
    %
    \[ ( II_W - II_W' ) \circ Q_R. \]
    %
    We note that, modulo a smoothing operator on $M$, which can be dealt with using a similar analysis to the operator $II_A$, for points in the coordinate system $G$ we can write
    %
    \[ Q_R \{ f \}(G(x)) = \int c_R(x,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot (x - y)} f(G(y))\; dy\; d\xi, \]
    %
    where $c_R$ is a symbol of order zero compactly supported in $x$, and supported on $|\xi| \sim R$, and satisfying uniform estimates of the form
    %
    \[ |D^\alpha_x D^\beta_\xi c_R(x,\xi)| \lesssim_{\alpha,\beta} |\xi|^{-\beta}. \]
    %
    The composition formula for a pseudodifferential operator with an oscillatory integral distribution implies that
    %
    \[ e^{- 2 \pi i \phi(x,y,t,\eta)} c_R(x,D) \{ a(x,y,\eta,t) [ 1 - \upsilon_R(\eta) ] e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,t,\eta)}  \} \]
    %
    is a symbol, whose asymptotic expansion at a value $(x,y,\eta,t)$ has coefficients given by differential operators applied to $c_R$ at the point $(x, \nabla_x \phi(x,y,t,\eta)) = \nabla_x \varphi(x,y,\eta)$. Now in order for this symbol not to be zero in a neighborhood of $(x,y,\eta,t)$, we must either have $|\eta| \leq C^{-1} \cdot R$ or $|\eta| \geq C \cdot R$, or the integrand will vanish by virtue of the support of $\upsilon$. In the former case, we will have $|\nabla_x \varphi(x,y,\eta)| \lesssim C^{-1} \cdot R$, which will be outside of the support of $c_R$ if $C$ is chosen suitably large. In the latter case, we will have $|\nabla_x \varphi(x,y,\eta)| \lesssim C \cdot R$, which will also not be in the support of $c_R$. Thus we conclude that
    %
    \[ c_R(x,D) \{ a(x,y,\eta,t) [ 1 - \upsilon_R(\eta) ] e^{2 \pi i \phi(x,y,t,\eta)} \]
    %
    is a symbol of order $-\infty$, uniformly in $R$, and this is sufficient to conclude that $(T_{W,t} - II_{W,t}) \circ Q_R$ is a smoothing operator, uniformly in $R$ and $t$. But then, as with the analysis of $II_A$, we conclude that $(II_W - II_W') \circ Q_R$ satisfies the required bounds above.
\end{proof}

It now suffices to study the boundedness of the operators $\{ II_W' \}$. We will denote this operator by $II_W$ in the sequel, given that bounds on this operator are equivalent to bounds on the operator $II_W'$, and that we no longer need to refer to the old operator $II_W$ until we are putting all our bounds together to bound the operator $M_R$. We will also abuse notation, conguating by the diffeomorphism $G$, and identify $II_W$ with the operator defined for functions on $\RR^d$ by the equation
%
\[ II_W f(x) = \iint b(t) a(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\eta) + t p(y,\eta)]} f(y)\; dy\; dt, \]
%
where $a$ is supported on $|\eta| \sim R$, satisfying the symbol bounds before.B

We now proceed similarly to the analysis of \cite{HeoandNazarovandSeeger} and \cite{LeeSeeger}, proving restricted weak-type estimates for the adjoint operators $II_W^*$. Consider a set $E \subset \RR^d$. Using equivalence of phase, if $K_W$ is the kernel of $II_W$, it is actually more helpful to switch to an expression of the form
%
\[ K_W(x,y) = \iint b(t) a(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,t,\eta) - \eta \cdot y]}\; d\eta \]
%
for a new phase function $\phi$. Applying a Fourier series in the $y$ variable, we can write
%
\[ a(x,y,\eta,t) = \sum_\nu a_\nu(x,\eta,t) \chi(y) e^{2 \pi i \nu \cdot y}, \]
%
where the terms $a_\nu$ are rapidly decaying in $\nu$. Using this rapid decay, we can ignore the oscillations in $\nu$ using the triangle inequality, and bound each term separately. We thus assume without loss of generality that $a(x,y,\eta,t) = a(x,\eta,t) \chi(y)$ for some smooth, compactly supported function $\chi$, equal to one on the support of the operator $II_W$.

We now consider a decomposition
%
\[ II_W = \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{T}} II_{W,t_0} \]
%
where $II_{W,t_0}$ has kernel $K_{W,t_0}$ given by
%
\[ K_{W,t_0}(x,y) = \iint b_{t_0}(t) a(x,y,\eta,t) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(x,t,\eta) - \eta \cdot y ]}. \]
%
Now



If $\upsilon \in C_c^\infty(\RR^d)$ is supported on $\{ C^{-1} \leq |\eta| \leq C \}$, and equal to one on $\{ (C/2)^{-1} \leq |\xi| \leq (C/2) \}$, for $C$ suitably large, and we set $\upsilon_R(\eta) = \upsilon ( \eta / R)$, then it follows from a composition calculation and the principle of non-stationary phase that $II_{W,R}$ differs from the frequency-localized operator
%
\begin{align*}
    II_{V,R} f(x) &= \iint b_R(t) V_{R,t}(x,y) f(y)\; dy\; dt\\
    &= \iiint b_R(t) a(x,y,\eta,t) \upsilon_R(\eta) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\eta) + t p(y,\eta)]}\; d\xi\; dy\; dt,
\end{align*}
%
by a smoothing operator uniformly bounded in $R$, provided we restrict $f$ to inputs coming from $V_R$. Similarily, if we consider the Littlewood-Paley cutoff $L_R = \upsilon_R(D)$, then
%
\[ II_{V,R} - II_{V,R} L_R \]
%
differs by a smoothing operator uniformly bounded in $R$ if we restrict our analysis to $f$ in $V_R$. TODO: Fill in details. It follows that we can now assume that our inputs have frequency localized on the Littlewood-Paley band with radius $R$. It thus suffices to obtain the bound given that our inputs are Littlewood-Paley localized at a scale $R$.

Given this property, and assuming $f$ has Littlewood-Paley support on $|\xi| \sim R$, then we can find a maximal $1/R$ separated subset $\mathcal{Y}_R$ of $X$, such that, on $X$, we can write
%
\[ f = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}_R} j(y) \psi_{R,y}, \]
%
where $\psi_{R,y}$ is adapted to the radius $O(1/R)$ ball centered at $y$. Then
%
\[ R^{-d/p} \| j \|_{l^p(\mathcal{Y}_R)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
For $t \in \mathcal{T}_R$, define
%
\[ II_{V,R,t}(x,y) = \iiint \eta_{R,t}(t') a(x,y,\eta,t) \upsilon_R(\eta) e^{2 \pi i [\phi(x,y,\eta) + t p(y,\eta)]}\; d\xi\;\; dt. \]
% To be analagous to Heo, Nasarov, and Seeger,
% chi_{t,y} should have L^1 mass t^{d-1}.
% Here, psi_{R,y} has mass R^{-d}, whereas II_{V,R,t}
% heuristically acts like a convolution by a function supported on
% the sphere of radius t, and thickness 1/R
% so it should have L^1 mass t^{d-1} R^{-d-1}
Set $\chi_{t,y} = II_{V,R,t} \psi_{R,y}$. Our proof would be complete if we could show that
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_R} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}_R} c(t) j(y) \chi_{j,y} \right\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \lesssim R^{\alpha_p - 1 + d/p} \| c(t) \cdot t^{\alpha_p} \|_{l^p(\mathcal{T}_R)} \| c \|_{l^p(\mathcal{Y}_R)}. \]
%
This is a special case of the more general inequality
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_R} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}_R} s(t,y) \chi_{j,y} \right\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \lesssim R^{\alpha_p - 1 + d/p} \| s(t,y) \cdot t^{\alpha_p}  \|_{l^p(\mathcal{T}_R \times \mathcal{Y}_R)}. \]
%
By applying real interpolation, it suffices to prove the result when $p = 1$, in which case we don't really expect to have much orthogonality to work with, and a restricted weak type inequality for some $p > 1$. Applying a dyadic decomposition in the $t$ variable, we can write this restricted weak type inequality as follows; for each $j \geq 5$, if we choose a finite set
%
\[ \mathcal{E}_j \subset \{ (t,r) \in \mathcal{T}_R \times \mathcal{Y}_R: 2^k \leq |t| \leq 2^{k+1} \}, \]
%
then
%
\[ \left\| \sum_j \sum_{(t,y) \in \mathcal{E}_j} \chi_{j,y} \right\|_{L^{p,\infty}(\Omega)} \lesssim R^{\alpha_p - 1 + d/p} \left( \sum_{5 \leq j \leq \log_2 R} [ \#(\mathcal{E}_j) 2^{j\alpha_p} ]^p \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
We will now perform a density decomposition, combined with some orthogonality estimates, to obtain further results.

    \[ \chi_{t_0,y_0}(x) = \iiint \eta_{R,t_0}(t) a(t,x,y,\tau) \psi_{R,y_0}(y) e^{2 \pi i \tau [ d_g(x,y) - |t| ]}\; d\tau\; dt\; dy, \]
    %
    where $a$ is a symbol of order $(d-1)/2$ and with support contained in $\{ |\tau| \sim R \}$. Fix $t_0, t_1$, $y_0$, and $y_1$, and consider the integral
    %
    \begin{align*}
        h_{t_0,t_1,y_0,y_1}(x) &= \iiint a(t_0,x,y_0,\tau_0) \overline{a(t_1,x,y_1,\tau_1)} e^{2 \pi i [ \tau_0 ( d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| ) - \tau_1 ( d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1| ) ]}\; d\tau_0\; d\tau_1\\
        &= \int \tilde{a}(t_0,t_1,x,y_0,y_1,\tau_0,\tau_1) e^{2 \pi i [ \tau_0 ( d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| ) - \tau_1 ( d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1| ) ]}\; d\tau_0\; d\tau_1 .
    \end{align*}
    %
    Integration by parts yields that
    % R^2 R^{(d-1)/2 - N} R^{(d-1)/2 - M}
    % R^{d+1 - N - M}
    \[ |h_{t_0,t_1,y_0,y_1}(x)| \lesssim_{N,M} R^{d+1-N-M} (d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| )^{-N} (d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1|)^{-M}. \]
    %
    This gives good bounds if $d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| \gtrsim 1/R$ or if $d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1| \gtrsim 1/R$. Conversely, if $d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| \lesssim 1/R$ and $d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1| \lesssim 1/R$, we just employ the trivial estimate $|h_{t_0,t_1,y_0,y_1}(x)| \lesssim R^{d+1}$.

    We now  calculate $\| h_{t_0,t_1,y_0,y_1} \|_{L^1_x}$. We split our analysis into several cases:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Case 1: $|t_0 - t_1| \lesssim 1/R$ and $d_g(y_0,y_1) \lesssim 1/R$}:

        By assumption, we have $|t_0|, |t_1| \gtrsim 1/R$. For $k \gtrsim 1$, we have
        %
        \[ d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| \sim 2^k / R \quad \text{if and only if} \quad d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1| \sim 2^k / R. \]
        %
        The set of such points is, for $|t_0| \gtrsim 2^k / R$, contained in the union of two annuli with thickness $O(2^k / R)$ and radius $\sim |t_0|$, and for $|t_0| \lesssim 2^k / R$, the union of a single annuli of thickness $O(2^k / R)$ and radius $\sim 2^k / R$. Thus the $L^1$ norm, away from the annulus $\{ d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| \lesssim 1/R \}$ can be upper bounded by
        % 2^k / R <= C |t_0|
        % 2^k <= C R |t_0|
        % k <= O(1) + log R + log |t_0|
        \begin{align*}
            &\sum_{k = O(1)}^{\log R - \log |t_0|^{-1} + O(1)} R^{d+1-N} (2^k / R)^{-N} |t_0|^{d-1} (2^k / R)\\
            &\quad \quad + \sum_{k = \log R - \log |t_0|^{-1} + O(1)} R^{d+1-M} (2^k / R)^{-M} (2^k / R)^d\\
            & = \sum_{k = O(1)}^{\log R - \log |t_0|^{-1} + O(1)} |t_0|^{d-1} R^d 2^{-(N-1)k}\\
            &\quad \quad + \sum_{k = \log R - \log |t_0|^{-1} + O(1)}^{\log R + O(1)} R 2^{-(M-d)k}\\
            & \lesssim_M |t_0|^{d-1} R^d + R^{-M}.
        \end{align*}
        %
        The $L^1$ norm over the annulus $\{ d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| \lesssim 1/R \}$ can be upper bounded by $|t_0|^{d-1} R^d$.

        \item {\bf Case 2: $|t_0 - t_1| \gtrsim 1/R$ and $d_g(y_0,y_1) \lesssim 1/R$}:

        Let us assume without loss of generality that $t_0 \leq t_1$. In this case, there do not exist any points $x$ where $d_g(x,y_0) - |t_0| \lesssim 1/R$ and $d_g(x,y_1) - |t_1| \lesssim 1/R$. 
    \end{itemize}
    %
    The cases above imply that
    %
    \[ \| \chi_{t_0,y_0} \|_{L^2_x} \lesssim_M \frac{|t_0|^{d-1}}{R^{d + 2}} + R^{-M}. \]
\end{proof}

Write
%
\[ G_j = \sum_{(t,y) \in \mathcal{E}_j} g_{j,y}. \]
%
We wish to now prove some $L^2$ estimates, which we can interpolate, namely, for the sum $G = \sum_j G_j$. Let us start by estimating the $L^2$ norm of each $G_j$ (Jongchon doesn't really exploit curvature here at all, i.e. just switching to the multiplier representation and applying local constancy).




TODO: We can pretend that for $(t,y) \in \mathcal{E}_j$, that $g_{j,y}$ is localized to a $O(2^j / R)$ ball centered at $y$.

Now let $\mathcal{B}_R$ denote a maximal $\sim 1/R$ separated subset of $\text{supp}_x(a)$. Then, by the uncertainty principle, we can find smooth functions $\{ \chi_{R,x} \}$ adapted to the family of $O(R)$ balls with centers in $\mathcal{B}_R$, and constants $\{ m_x \}$ such that
%
\[ K_{R,t}(x,y) = \sum_{x_0 \in \mathcal{B}_R} m_{x_0} \chi_{R,x_0}(x) K_{R,t}(x,y), \]
%
where $K_{R,t,x_0}(x,y) = $

 We perform a further decomposition, writing
%
\[ II_{W,R} = \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{T}_R} \sum_{x_0 \in \mathcal{B}_R} c_{t_0,x_0} II_{W,R,t_0,x_0}, \]
%
where
%
\[ II_{W,R,t_0,x_0} f(x) = \int \int_U \eta_{R,t_0}(t) \chi_{R,x_0}(x) K_{R,t}(x,y) f(y)\; dy\; dt, \]
%
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}

Let $\Theta_R$ be a maximal $R^{-1/2}$ separated subset of $S^{d-1}$. For $\nu \in \Theta_l$, let
%
\[ \Gamma^R_\nu = \{ \xi \in \RR^d: | \pi^\perp_\nu \xi | \lesssim R^{-1/2} \xi \} \]
%
denote the sector with aperture $\sim R^{-1/2}$ pointing in the direction $\xi$. Let $\{ \chi_{R,\nu} \}$ be a smooth partition of unity adapted to these sectors, and then set
%
\[ II_{V,R,t,\nu} f(x) = \iiint \eta_{R,t}(t') \upsilon_R(\xi) \chi_{R,\nu}(\xi) a(t',x,y, \xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(x,y,\xi,t')} f(y) \; d\xi\; dy\; dt'. \]
%
Let $K_{V,R,t,\nu}$ denote the kernel of this operator. Then bringing in absolute values shows that
%
\[ \| K_{V,R,t,\nu} \|_{L^\infty_{x,y}} \lesssim R^{-1} \cdot R^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \cdot R = R^{\frac{d-1}{2}}.  \]
%
Moreover, $K_{V,R,t,\nu}(\cdot, y$ is concentrated on a thickness $t R^{-1/2}$ by $1/R$ cap centered at the point $\exp_y(- t \nu)$, rapidly decaying away from this value. Thus we conclude that
%
\[ \| K_{V,R,t,\nu} \|_{L^\infty_y L^p_x} \lesssim t^{\frac{d-1}{p}} R^{\frac{1}{p^*} \frac{d+1}{2} - 1}. \]
%
But putting these terms together gives that
%
\[ \| K_{V,R,t} \|_{L^\infty_y L^p_x} \lesssim t^{\frac{d-1}{p}} R^{\frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}}.\]
%
If $\theta_{R,\nu}$ denotes a slightly thickened cap around $\exp_y(- t \nu)$, then we can also prove that
%
\[ \| K_{V,R,t} \|_{L^\infty_y L^p_x(\theta_{R,\nu}^c)} \lesssim_N R^{-N}. \]
%
Now let's use the fact that we can replace $f$ by $L_R f$ in the argument. Applying the uncertainty principle, we can find a maximal family $\mathcal{B}_R$ of $O(1/R)$ separated points on $\text{supp}_y(a)$, we can find a family of functions $\{ \varphi_{R,y}: x \in \mathcal{B}_R \}$, adapted to the family of $O(1/R)$ centered at points in $\mathcal{B}_R$, and we can then write
%
\[ f = \sum m_{R,y} \varphi_{R,x}, \]
%
where
%
\[ \| f \|_{L^p} \sim R^{-d/p} \| m \|_{l^p_x(\mathcal{B}_R)}. \]
%
Define functions $g_{R,t,x,\nu} = II_{V,R,t,\nu} \{ \varphi_{R,x} \}$, and let $g_{R,t,x} = \sum_{\nu \in \Theta_R} g_{R,t,x,\nu}$. Our proof would be completed if we could show that
%
\[ \| \sum_{t,y} c_{R,t} m_{R,y} g_{R,t,y} \|_{L^p_x} \lesssim R^{\alpha_p - 1 - d/p} \| t^{\alpha_p} c_{R,t} \|_{l^p_t(\mathcal{T}_R)} \| m \|_{l^p_y(\mathcal{B}_R)}. \]
%
Let's obtain some $L^2$ estimates, which require understanding the quantities
%
\begin{align*}
    &\langle g_{R,t_1,y_1}, g_{R,t_2,y_2} \rangle\\
    &\quad \sum_{\nu_1,\nu_2} \int \eta_{R,t_1}(t) \eta_{R,t_2}(t') \upsilon_R(\xi) \upsilon_R(\xi') \varphi_{R,y_1}(y) \varphi_{R,y_1}(y) \varphi_{R,y_2}(y') \chi_{R,\nu_1}(\xi) \chi_{R,\nu_2}(\xi') a(t,x,y,\xi) \overline{a(t',x,y',\xi')} e^{2 \pi i [\Phi(x,y,\xi,t) - \Phi(x,y',\xi',t')]}.
\end{align*}
%
We write
%
\[ \langle \]

%
We thus calculate that
%
\[ \widehat{g}_{R,t,y}(\xi) = \iint \eta_{R,t}(t') \upsilon_R(\xi) \chi_{R,\nu}(\xi) \varphi_{R,y}(y') \mathfrak{a}(t',x,y, \xi) e^{2 \pi i [\Phi(x,y,\xi,t') - \xi \cdot x]} f(y) \; dy'\; dt'. \]


To obtain a kind of $L^2$ estimate, let's analyze the operators
%
\[ II_{V,R,t_1} II_{V,R,t_2}^* = \sum_{\nu_1,\nu_2} II_{V,R,t_1,\nu_1} II_{V,R,t_2,\nu_2}^*. \]
%
%The kernel of $II_{V,R,t_1,\nu_1} II_{V,R,t_2,\nu_2}^*$ is equal to
%
%\[ \int \eta_{R,t_1}(t) \eta_{R,t_2}(s) \upsilon_R(\xi) \upsilon_R(\eta) \chi_{R,\nu_1}(\xi) \chi_{R,\nu_2}(\xi) \overline{a(t,x,z,\xi)} a(s,z,y,\eta) e^{2 \pi i [ \Phi(z,y,\eta,s) - \Phi(x,z,\xi,t)]}\; d\xi d\eta dt ds dz. \]
%
% At least from a wavefront set analysis, we should expect
% this quantity to be concentrated near (x,xi,y,eta) such
% that there exists (z,zeta) such that
%       * (x,xi)  = Phi_{t_1}(z, zeta)
%       * (y,eta) = Phi_{t_2}(z, zeta)
% So (y,eta) = Phi_{t_2 - t_1}(x,xi)

We can rewrite this quantity as
%
\[ R^{2d} \int \eta_{R,t_1}(t) \eta_{R,t_2}(s) \upsilon(\xi) \upsilon(\eta) \chi_{R,\nu_1}(\xi) \chi_{R,\nu_2}(\xi) \overline{a(t,x,z,R \xi)} a(s,z,y,R \eta) e^{2 \pi i R [ \Phi(z,y,\eta,s) - \Phi(x,z,\xi,t) ]}\; d\xi d\eta dt ds dz. \]
%
Let us try and do a similar argument to analyze
%
\[ \langle K_{V,R,t_1}, K_{V,R,t_2} \rangle = \sum_{\nu_1,\nu_2} \langle K_{V,R,t_1,\nu_1}, K_{V,R,t_1,\nu_2} \rangle. \]


Thus we conclude that
%
% phi(x,y,t,nu) = (x - y) xi + t |nu|_g
% nabla_xi = x - y + t |nu|_g
\[ \| K_{V,R,t,\nu} \|_{L^\infty_x L^1_y} \lesssim t^{d-1} R^{-1}. \]
%
If
%
\[ K_{V,R,t} = \sum_\nu K_{V,R,t,\nu}, \]
%
be the kernel of $II_{V,R,t}$, then the triangle inequality simply implies from this that
%
\[ \| K_{V,R,t} \|_{L^\infty_x L^1_y} \lesssim t^{d-1} R^{\frac{d-3}{2}}. \]
%
We thus conclude by Schur's Lemma that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| II_{V,R} f \|_{L^1_x} &= \| \sum c_{R,t} II_{V,R,t} f \|_{L^1_x} \leq R^{\frac{d-3}{2}} \| c_{R,t} \cdot t^{d-1} \|_{l^1_t(\mathcal{T}_R)} \| f \|_{L^1_x}.
\end{align*}
%
Let us suppose that an analogy of the variable coefficient Wolff-type decoupling inequalities, ala that of Beltran, Hickman, and Sogge, holds, i.e. that
%
\[ \| II_{V,R} f \|_{L^p} \lesssim_{p,\varepsilon} R^{s_p - 1/p + \varepsilon} \left\| \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_R} c_{R,t} II_{V,R,t,\nu} f \right\|_{l^p_\nu(\Theta_R) L^p_x}. \]
% 2(d+1)/(d-1) <= p^*
% (d-1)/2(d+1) >= 1/p^*
% 1 - (d-1)/2(d+1) <= 1/p
% (d + 3)/2(d+1) <= 1/p
% p <= 2(d+1)/(d+3)
% vs. p <= 2(d-1)/(d+1)
Schur's Lemma implies that
%
\[ \| \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_R} c_{R,t} \| \]

Then, using the fact that
%
\[ \| \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_R} c_{R,t} II_{V,R,t,\nu} f \| \]
% We can partition the support of f into 1/R balls, on which the function is constant.
% Cap of size t^{d-1} R^{-1}
% Looks like a geometric averaging operator.
% Some kind of Lp improving thing?

A standard stationary phase argument shows that the kernel $K_{L,R,t_0,\nu}$ has maximum value
%
\[ O(1/R) \cdot  \]

A standard stationary phase argument shows that the kernel $K_{W,R,i,l,\nu}$ of $II_{W,R,i,l,\nu}$ satisfies bounds of the form
%
\[ |K_{W,R,i,l,\nu}(x,y)| \lesssim_N \int_{(i-1)/R}^{(i+5/4)/R} \frac{2^{\frac{l(d+1)}{2}}}{(1 + 2^l | \pi_\nu( \nabla_\xi \Phi(x,y,\nu,t) ) | + 2^{l/2} | \pi_\nu^\perp ( \nabla_\xi \Phi(x,y,\nu,t) ) | )^N}\; dt. \]
%
We note that
%
\[ \nabla_\xi \Phi(x,y,\nu,t) = \exp(t \nu) + x - y + O(|x - y|^2), \]
%
so that for a fixed $x$, $K_{W,R,i,l,\nu}$ is supported on 

% \nabla_xi Phi(x,t,\nu)
% (x - y) * xi + t |xi|_g + O(|x - y|^2 |xi|)
%   -> x - y + t/2 ( sum g_{ij} xi^i xi^j )^{-1/2} * ( sum_j g_{ij} xi^j + g_{ii} \xi^i )



We will attempt to use the method of Lee and Seeger, combined with the methods of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger, to analyze this kernel by discretizing at a scale $1/R$, and applying a variant of the Calderon-Zygmund type decomposition that Heo, Nazarov and Seeger use to show that we have an $l^p L^p$ decoupling type bound for these quantities.

In Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger, it helped to introduce an additional oscillatory factor into the estimates, which is possible because the multiplier they are studying is supported at the unit scale (in particular, away from the origin). In our situation, since $m$ was compactly supported on the annulus $1/2 \leq |\xi| \leq 2$, we can do something similar. Let $\psi$ be an even, compactly supported smooth function on the real line, whose Fourier transform is non-negative, vanishes to high order at the origin, but is nonvanishing on the annulus $1/4 \leq |\xi| \leq 4$. It suffices to show the multiplier
%
\[ \tilde{m}(\lambda) = \widehat{\psi}(\lambda) m(\lambda), \]
%
is in $M_{\text{Dil}}^p(M)$. This is because the operator $\lambda \mapsto 1/\widehat{\psi}(\lambda)$ is smooth on the support of $m$, and thus satisfies uniform $L^p$ estimates on it's dilations by $R$ provided the inputs are linear combinations of eigenfunctions with frequency $\sim R$. But this is sufficient to conclude that $m$ is in $M_{\text{Dil}}^p(M)$. In the sequel, set
%
\[ b_R(t) = \chi_{II,R}(t) \cdot R \cdot (\psi * \widehat{h})(Rt). \]
%
The symbol $\tilde{m}$ satifies all the same estimates that $m$ satisfies, and so the previous part of the argument carries through for this multiplier, and it remains to analyze the times $1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim 1$ more carefully. It suffices to bound the operators $T_R$, with kernels
%
\begin{align*}
    K_R(x,y) &= \iint b_R(t) s(x,y,\xi,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dt\\
    &= \iiint \chi_{II,R}(t) [R \psi(R(t - u))] [R\widehat{h}(Ru)] s(x,y,\xi,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dt\; du\\
    &= \int [R \widehat{h}(Ru)] F_{y,u}(x)\; du,
\end{align*}
%
where
%
\begin{align*}
    F_{y,u}(x) = \iint \chi_{II,R}(t) [R \psi(R(u - t))] s(x,y,\xi,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} \; d\xi\; dt.
\end{align*}
%
We are `averaging' (by an oscillatory quantity) over a $O(1/R)$ neighborhood of $u$, and thus we should expect from the wavefront set analysis of $F_{y,u}$ that this function has mass concentrated on an annulus of thickness $O(1/R)$ and radius $u$, centered at $y$.

Now our goal is to prove bounds of the form
%
\[ \left\| \int_{1/R \lesssim |u| \lesssim 1} \int_U f(y) [R \widehat{h}(Ru)] F_{y,u}(x)\; dy\; du \right\|_{L^p_x} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p_y} \]
%
which are uniform in $R$. We know that
%
\begin{align*}
    &\left( \int_{1/R \lesssim |u| \lesssim 1} |R \widehat{h}(Ru)|^p |u|^{(d-1)(1-p/2)} \; du \right)^{1/p} \lesssim R^{-s_{p^*}} C_p(h).
\end{align*}
%
Moreover, the function $R \widehat{h}(Ru)$ is locally constant at a scale $1/R$ by the uncertainty principle.

Thus our argument will follow if we can justify that for functions $a$, which are supported on $1/R \lesssim |u| \lesssim 1$,
%
\[ \left\| \iint a(y,u) F_{y,u}\; dy\; du \right\|_{L^p_x} \lesssim R^{s_{p^*}} C_p(h) \left( \iint |a(y,u)|^p |u|^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)}\; dy\; du \right)^{1/p}. \]
%

By applying the triangle inequality, and applying symmetry, we may assume that $a$ is actually supported on $1/R \lesssim u \lesssim 1$ (i.e. we only consider positive values of $u$). It's a little suspicious that the exponent of $|u|$ on the right hand side is different from the exponent that is seen in Heo-Nasarov-Seeger, but I'll ask Andreas about this later and we'll see if it's a problem.

Discretizing as in that paper, it suffices to prove the following discretized version of this result at a scale $1/R$; if $\mathcal{E}$ is any $1/R$ discretized subset of $(y,u)$ pairs,
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{(y,u) \in \mathcal{E}} a(y,u) F_{y,u} \right\|_{L^p_x} \lesssim R^{s_{p^*}} \left( \sum_{(y,u) \in \mathcal{E}} |a(y,u)|^p |u|^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)} \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
Applying real interpolation, it actually suffices to show, if $\mathcal{E}_k$ is the set of all $(y,u)$ pairs with $2^k / R \leq u \leq 2^{k+1} / R$, then
%
\[ \left\| \sum_{(y,u) \in \mathcal{E}_k} F_{y,u} \right\|_{L^p_x} \lesssim R^{s_{p^*}} \left( \sum_k 2^{k(d-1)(1 - p/2)} \#(\mathcal{E}_k) \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
The values of $k$ for which $\mathcal{E}_k$ is nonempty occur for $1 \lesssim k \lesssim \log R$.

We can further perform a frequency decomposition in $\xi$. We begin by writing, for $j \gtrsim 1$,
%
\begin{align*}
    F_{y,u,j}(x) &= \iint \chi_{II,R}(t) [R \psi(R(u - t))] \beta(\xi / 2^j) s(x,y,\xi,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\\
    &= 2^{jd} \iint \chi_{II,R}(t) [R \psi(R(u - t))] \beta(\xi) s(x,y,2^j \xi,t) e^{2 \pi i 2^j \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dt.
\end{align*}
%
If $|d_g(x,y) - u| \gtrsim 1/R$, then the principle of nonstationary phase yields that
%
\[ |F_{y,u,j}(x)| \lesssim_N 2^{j(d-N)} (|d_g(x,y) - u| - 1/R)^{-N}. \]
%
Whereas for $|d_g(x,y) - u| \lesssim 1/R$, taking in absolute values simply gives
%
\[ |F_{y,u,j}(x)| \lesssim 2^{jd}. \]
%
We can do better than this by performing a further decomposition. Let $\Theta_j$ be a maximal $2^{-j/2}$ separated subset of unit vectors on the sphere, consider an associated homogeneous partition of unity $\{ a_\theta \}$ and write
%
\[ F_{y,u,j} = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta_j} F_{y,u,\theta}, \]
%
where
%
\[ F_{y,u,\theta}(x) = \iint a_\theta(\xi) \chi_{II,R}(t) [R \psi(R(u - t))] s(x,y,\xi,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)} \; d\xi\; dt. \]
%


On the other hand, if $|d_g(x,y) - u| \lesssim 1/R$, then we must employ a stationary phase analysis. If $|d_g(x,y) - u| \lesssim 1/R$, the region upon which TODO. IDEA: Maybe the analysis will be more simple if we use the Hadamard parametrix since the phase simplifies.

% int lambda^{-N} psi^(lambda / R) e^{2 pi i lambda (u - t)} d lambda
% R^{-N} int (lambda/R)^{-N} psi^(lambda / R) e^{2 pi i lambda (u-t)} d lambda
% R^{-N} R psi^{(N)}(R(u - t))




Now perform a frequency decomposition, writing
%
\begin{align*}
    K_R(x,y) &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \int b_R(t) \eta(\xi / 2^k) s(x,y,\xi,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\\
    &= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \int s_{R,k}(x,y,\xi / 2^k,t) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\\

%
where

\[ s_{R,k}(x,y,\xi,t) = b_R(t) \eta(\xi) s(x,y,2^k \xi, t). \]
%
%satisfies the estimates
%
\[ |D^{n_1}_x D^{n_2}_y D^{n_3}_\xi D^{n_4}_t s_{R,k}(x,y,\xi,t)| \lesssim_n R^{n_4+1}. \]


\newpage



It remains to analyze the operator over small times, i.e. the operator
%
\[ I_R = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}. \]
%


Let us write
%
\[ I_R = I_{R,1} + I_{R,2}, \]
%
where
%
\[ I_{R,0} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} R \widehat{h}(Rt) \eta(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} a_{R,0}(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt. \]
%
and
%
\[ I_{R,1} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} R \widehat{h}(Rt) (1 - \eta(Rt)) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} a_{R,1}(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt. \]
%
Now
%
\begin{align*}
    \| a_{R,0} \|_{L^p_t} &= R^{1/p^*} \left( \int |\widehat{h}(t)|^p |\eta(t)|^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
    &\lesssim R^{1/p} C_p(h),
\end{align*}
%
and
%
\begin{align*}
    \| a_{R,1} \|_{L^p_t} &= R^{1/p^*} \left( \int |\widehat{h}(t)|^p |(1 - \eta(t)|^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
    &\lesssim R^{1/p^*} \left( \int_{10}^R |\widehat{h}(t)|^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
    &\lesssim R^{1/p^*} C_p(h) \left( \int_{10}^R |t|^{-(d-1)(p^*/2 - 1)} \right)^{1/p^*}\\
    &\lesssim R^{1/p^*} C_p(h).
\end{align*}
%
We analyze each of these cases separately.

There are several approaches to analyzing $I_{R,1}$ using local smoothing, and they all don't seem to work so well:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item We apply H\"{o}lder to write
    %
    \begin{align*}
        |I_{R,1} f| &\leq \| a_{R,1} \|_{L^p} \left( \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \leq 1/2} |e^{2 \pi i t P} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*}\\
        &\leq C_p(h) R^{1/p^*} \left( \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \leq 1/2} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    Now by periodicity, we should have
    %
    \[ \left( \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \leq 1/2} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \left( R^{-1} \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim R} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*}. \]
    % 
    and local smoothing implies that
    %
    \[ \left( R^{-1} \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim R} \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}}^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}} \lesssim R^{\alpha_{p^*}} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}. \]
    %
    But this means that
    %
    \[ \| I_{R,1} f \|_{L^{p^*}} \leq C_p(h) R^{1/p^* + \alpha_{p^*}} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}} = C_p(h) R^{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}. \]
    %
    This isn't a good enough bound to obtain what was required.

    \item We could write
    %
    \[ I_{R,1} = \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} I_{R,k}, \]
    %
    where
    %
    \[ I_{R,k} = \int \eta(Rt - k) R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} = \int a_{R,k}(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}. \]
    %
    %\begin{align*}
    %    &\left( \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p}^p \right)^{1/p}\\
    %    &\quad\quad \sim R^{1-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \left( \int \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} |\eta(Rt-k)|^p |\widehat{h}(Rt)|^p \right)^{1/p}\\
    %    &\quad\quad \sim R^{1/p^* - (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \left( \int_{|t| \sim 1} |\widehat{h}(t)|^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
    %    &\quad\quad \lesssim R^{1/p^* - (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} C_p(h).
    %\end{align*}
    %
    If we were able to justify that for all $R > 0$, and all $1 \lesssim k \lesssim R$,
    %
    \[ \left( R \int_{\frac{k}{R}}^{\frac{k + 1}{R}} \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}}^{p^*}\; dt \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}}, \]
    %
    then H\"{o}lder would imply that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \| I_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} &\lesssim \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p} \left( \int_{|t| = k/R + O(1/R)} \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}}^{p^*}\; dt \right)^{1/p^*}\\
        &\lesssim \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p} R^{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)-2/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}.
    \end{align*}
    %
    %On the other hand, for $k \gtrsim 1$, we can apply the fixed time Sobolev estimates for the wave equation together with H\"{o}lder's inequality to conclude that
    % If a_{R,k} has height H_{R,k}
    % then (sum |k|^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)} H_{R,k}^p)^{1/p} << R^{1 - (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)}
    % for p <= r
    %\begin{align*}
    %    \| I_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} &\lesssim \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p} \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}_x(M) L^{p^*}_t[-1/R,1/R]}\\
    %    &\lesssim \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p} R^{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)-1/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}.
    %\end{align*}
    %
    Trivially applying the triangle inequality and H\"{o}lder's inequality yields that
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} \| I_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} &\lesssim R^{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)-2/p^*} \left( \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p} \right) \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}\\
        &\lesssim C_p(h) \| f \|_{L^{p^*}},
    \end{align*}
    %
    This is a bound uniform in $R$.

    Unfortunately, we cannot expect to obtain a bound of the form
    %
    \[ \left( R \int_{\frac{k}{R}}^{\frac{k + 1}{R}} \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}}^{p^*}\; dt \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}} \]
    %
    which holds uniformly in $k$ and $R$, even if $f$ is a linear combination of eigenfunctions with eigenvalue about $R$. To see why, let $k = R/2$, and let $f$ be a sum of wave packets of the form
    %
    \[ f(x) = \sum e^{- 2 \pi i R \nu_\theta \cdot x} f_\theta(x), \]
    %
    where $\{ \theta \}$ is a collection of $O(1/\delta^{d-1})$ caps on an annulus of radius $\sim 1$ and thickness $\delta^2$, where the caps have dimension $\delta^2$ in the direction of the normal vector $\nu_\theta$ to $\theta$, and $\delta$ in tangential directions. The functions $\{ f_\theta \}$ are then bump functions adapted to $\theta$. By the uncertainty principle, we can make the frequency support of $f_\theta$ be mostly supported on $|\xi| \sim R$ provided that $\delta \gtrsim R^{-1/2}$. Let us set $\delta = R^{-1/2}$. Then we have
    %
    \[ |\nabla^\alpha f| \sim_\alpha \max(R^\alpha,\delta^{-2\alpha}) = R^\alpha. \]
    %
    Thus if $\delta \gtrsim R^{-1/2}$, then $|\nabla^\alpha f| \sim_\alpha R^\alpha$, and we get that
    %
    \[ \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_\alpha} \sim_\alpha R^\alpha \delta^{2/p^*} = R^{\alpha - 1/p^*}. \]
    %
    Now let us consider
    %
    \[ \int_{1/2}^{1/2 + 1/R} \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}}^{p^*}\; dt. \]
    %
    The frequency support of $e^{-2 \pi i R \nu_\theta} f_\theta$ is concentrated on the dual cap $\theta^*$ centered at $-  R \nu_\theta$. In particular, we have uncertainty $O(R)$ in the normal direction, and uncertainty $O(R^{1/2})$ in the tangential direction. But this means we have an angular uncertainty of about $O(1/R^{1/2})$, so that at each time $t \in [1/2, 1/2 + 1/R]$, $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}$ has the majority of it's mass on a cap $\theta_t$, which is a dilation of $\theta$ by a constant factor.

    In particular, $\theta_t$ contains a ball of radius $1/R$, and on this ball, has real part $\gtrsim 1/2$. But this means that $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f$ has mass at least $O(1/\delta^{d-1})$ on this ball, and so
    %
    \[ \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}} \gtrsim \frac{R^{-d/p^*}}{\delta^{d-1}} = R^{ \frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{d}{p^*} }. \]
    %
    Thus if the bound held uniformly in $R$, we would have
    %
    \[ R^{ \frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{d}{p^*} } \lesssim R^{\alpha - 1/p^*}, \]
    %
    and thus we would have
    %
    \[ \alpha \geq \frac{d-1}{2} + \frac{1}{p^*} - \frac{d}{p^*} = (d-1) \left( 1/2 - 1/p^* \right). \]
    %
    In other words, this bound can \emph{only} hold as a fixed time estimate form an interval of length $1/R$ significantly away from the origin.

    If we instead perform this construction at some other $k \gtrsim 1$, we would get estimates of the form
    %
    \[ \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}} \gtrsim (k/R)^{d-1} \frac{R^{-d/p^*}}{\delta^{d-1}} = k^{d-1} R^{-\frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{d}{p^*} }. \]
    %
    Thus if we had a bound uniform in $R$ for this particular value of $k$, we would expect that
    %
    \[ k^{d-1} R^{- \frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{d}{p^*}} \lesssim R^{\alpha - 1/p}. \]
    %
    Thus
    %
    \begin{align*}
        \alpha &\geq (d-1) \log_R(k) + \frac{1}{p} - \frac{d-1}{2} - \frac{d}{p^*}\\
        &= (d-1)(\log_R(k) - 1) + (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p).
    \end{align*}
    %
    Thus it might still be possible to get a uniform bound in the range
    %
    \[ k \lesssim R^{1 - \frac{1}{(d-1) p^*}}. \]
    %
    TODO: Maybe look into seeing if this is provable, which would then allow us to restrict to a time interval of length $O(R^{-1/(d-1) p^*})$.
\end{itemize}

%Let us write $I_R = \sum_{|k| \lesssim R} I_{R,k}$, where
%
%
%The fact that $h$ has compact support implies that each of the functions $\{ a_{R,k} \}$ is morally a constant multiple of the indicator function supported on a time interval of length $\sim 1/R$, centered at the point $k/R$. Now in this case we also have that for $|k| \lesssim 1$,
%
%\[ \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p} \lesssim R^{1/p^*} C_p(h) \]
%
%and
%
%\begin{align*}
%    &\left( \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} \| a_{R,k} \|_{L^p}^p \right)^{1/p}\\
%    &\quad\quad \sim R^{1-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \left( \int \sum_{1 \lesssim |k| \lesssim R} |\eta(Rt-k)|^p |\widehat{h}(Rt)|^p \right)^{1/p}\\
%    &\quad\quad \sim R^{1/p^* - (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \left( \int_{|t| \sim 1} |\widehat{h}(t)|^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
%    &\quad\quad \lesssim R^{1/p^* - (d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} C_p(h).
%\end{align*}
%
%We break our analysis into these cases separately.

%To study $I_{R,k}$ for $|k| \lesssim 1$, we just take an inverse Fourier transform, i.e. writing
%
%\[ I_{R,k} = m_{k,R} \Big( \sqrt{-\Delta} \Big), \]
%
%where, if $\beta$ denotes the inverse Fourier transform of $\eta$, then
% eta(Rt - k)
% has inverse Fourier transform
% b(lambda) = int eta(Rt - k) e^{2 pi i t lambda}
% = 1/R * int eta(t - k) e^{2 pi i t lambda / R}
% = e^{2 pi i lambda k / R} 1/R int eta(t) e^{2 pi i lambda t / R}
% int eta(t) e^{- 2 pi i lambda (t + k)} beta(lambda / R)
%\[ m_{k,R}(\lambda) = \int h(\alpha) e^{- 2 \pi i \left( \frac{\lambda - \alpha}{R} \right) k} \beta \left( \frac{\lambda - \alpha}{R} \right)\; d\alpha. \]
%
%Then for $\lambda \geq 10$,
%
%\[ |D^N m_{k,R}(\lambda)| \lesssim_{N,M} \| h \|_{L^\infty(\RR)} R^{-N} \langle \lambda / R \rangle^{-M}. \]
%
%But this implies that $\{ m_{k,R} \}$ are a family of symbols of order zero, uniformly bouned in this symbol class for all $k$ and $R$. But this implies that $I_{R,k}$ is bounded in $L^p(M)$ for all $1 < p < \infty$. Thus $\sum_{|k| \lesssim 1} I_{R,k}$ is bounded in $L^p(M)$ for $1 < p < \infty$, and thus we immediately obtain $L^{p^*} \to L^{p^*}$ bounds which are uniform in $R$.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
Using e.g. Kakeya like techniques, maybe we can shift the locations of the caps so that these caps have lots of overlap, i.e. so that if $\theta_t'$ denotes the closest $10\%$ of the cap $\theta_t$ to the origin, then for any $\varepsilon > 0$, if $R$ is suitably large,
%
\[ \bigcup \theta_t' \leq \varepsilon. \]
%
The wave packets have disjoint frequency support, so
%
\[ \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \sim (1/\delta)^{\frac{d-1}{2}} \delta^{\frac{d+1}{2}} = \delta. \]
%
Applying dyadic pidgeonholing, this means that there exists a set $E$ with $|E| \leq \varepsilon$ such that
%
\[ |(e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f)(x)| \sim \delta |E|^{-1/2} \]
%
for $x \in E$ and $t \in [1/2,1/2 + 1/R]$. But this means that
%
\[ \| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \|_{L^{p^*}} \gtrsim \delta |E|^{1/p^* - 1/2} \]
%
But this means that
%
\[ |E|^{1/p^* - 1/2} \lesssim R^{\alpha - 1/p^* - 1/2} \]
% R^{alpha - 1/p^*}
Taking $\varepsilon \to 0$ gives that we must have $\alpha > 1/p^* + 1/2$.

\section{Aside: Euclidean Case}

Can we prove a similar result for Euclidean multipliers? If we suppose the endpoint local smoothing conjecture held in Euclidean space at a particular exponent $2d/(d-1) < p^* < \infty$, is it then possible to prove the radial multiplier conjecture at the exponent $p$ (and by symmetry, also for $p^*$)? We do not have periodicity in this settings, so that `large times' are qualitatively different than small times. But we do have rescalability, i.e. so we do not need to introduce a parameter $R$ into the argument.

So let's consider a unit scale radial multiplier of the form
%
\[ T = h \Big( \sqrt{-\Delta} \Big), \]
%
To understand this operator, we consider the Fourier transform, writing
%
\[ Tf = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \widehat{h}(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt. \]
%
Let us assume that
%
\[ \int \langle t \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)} |\widehat{h}(t)|^p \; dt < \infty. \]
%
Suppose we set
%
\[ I f = \int \eta_0(t) \widehat{h}(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt, \]
%
and
%
\[ II f = \sum_{|m| \gtrsim 1} T_m, \]
%
where
%
\[ T_m = \int \phi(t - m) \widehat{h}(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt = \int a_m(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}\; dt. \]
%
Then local smoothing (together with a dyadic decomposition if the local smoothing conjecture only is proved at a unit scale) implies that
%
\[ \| I f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p*}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
On the other hand,
%
\[ \sum |m|^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)} \| a_m \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]}^p \lesssim 1. \]
%
H\"{o}lder's inequality thus implies that we have a pointwise bound of the form
%
\[ |T_m f| \lesssim \| a_m \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} \left\| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \right\|_{L^{p^*}[m-1/2,m+1/2]}. \]
%
Thus
%
\[ \| T_m f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| a_m \|_{L^p[-1/2,1/2]} \left\| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \right\|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d) L^{p^*}[m-1/2,m+1/2]}. \]
%
And so H\"{o}lder's inequality implies that
%
\[ \sum_{|m| \gtrsim 1} \| T_m f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \left( \sum_{|m| \gtrsim 1} |m|^{-(d-1)(p^*/2 - 1)} \left\| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \right\|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d) L^{p^*}[m-1/2,m+1/2]}^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*}. \]
%
Because of the choice of $p^*$, we \emph{could} replace the right hand side with a supremum in $m$. Thus our goal is to prove that
%
\[ \sup_{|m| \gtrsim 1} \left\| e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \right\|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d) L^{p^*}[m-1/2,m+1/2]} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
But this is a problem, since we cannot prove this bound, i.e. using a similar counterexample to the example considered before. We can also see why intuitively here by rescaling, i.e. writing this bound as an integral over the time interval $[ 1 - 1/2m, 1 + 1/2m ]$. For large $m$, it makes sense that this would quantity would behave like the pointwise wave equation.

\end{comment}

%Suppose that
%
%\[ \sup_{R > 0} \int |\mathcal{F}(\varphi \text{Dil}_R m)(x)|\; dx < \infty. \]
%
%Let $m_k(\xi) = \phi(\xi/2^k) m(x)$. Then the condition says that the Fourier transform of $\text{Dil}_{1/2^k} m_k$ is uniformly bounded in $L^1$. But this tells us that
%
%\[ 2^{-kd} \int \text{Dil}_{2^k} \widehat{m_k}\; dx \lesssim 1, \]
%
%i.e. that
%
%\[ \int \widehat{m_k}(\xi)\; d\xi \lesssim 1. \]
%
%Thus the Fourier transform of $\widehat{m_k}$ is uniformly integrable in $k$, which tells us by Young's inequality that for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, 
%
%\[ \| m_k(D) f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
%But now Littlewood-Paley theory tells us that for $1 < p < \infty$,
%
%\[ \| m(D) f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_p \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]

\section{Inefficient Calculation}

% TODO: Maybe an L^infty norm is not tight here
% because the contribution from each slice of h^ is different
% The L^1 norm of H_R is equal to the L^1 norm of h^, which is uniform in R.
% The triangle inequality is the best we can do since each 1/R translate of h^ might look the same
% scaled down so that the integrability condition is satisfied
% We know that sum

\begin{align*}
    \left| \sum_{l = -\infty}^\infty \widehat{h}(R(t + l)) \right| &\lesssim \left( \sum_{l = -\infty}^\infty |\widehat{h}(R(t + l))|^p \langle R(t + l) \rangle^{(d-1)(1 - p/2)} \right)^{1/p}\\
    &\quad\quad\quad \left( \sum_{l \neq 0} \langle R(t + l) \rangle^{-(d-1)(p^*/2 - 1)} \right)^{1/p^*}\\
    &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)}.
\end{align*}
%
TODO: Do we have mixed norm local smoothing estimates?

%
Thus we conclude that
%
\[ |H_R(t)| \lesssim C_p(h) R^{1-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)}. \]
%
This means that
%
\[ \left| \int H_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f \right| \lesssim C_p(h) R^{1-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f |\; dt. \]



%
If $d(t,\mathbf{Z}) = s$ for some $s \in [0,1/2]$, then since $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$, using the local constancy of $\widehat{h}$ given that $h$ is compactly supported, we have
%
\begin{align*}
    &\left( \sum_{l = -\infty}^\infty \langle R(t + l) \rangle^{-(d-1)(p^*/2 - 1)} \right)^{1/p^*} \sim \langle Rs \rangle^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)}.
%    &\quad \quad \sim \begin{cases} 1 &: t \leq 1/R, \\ (t/R) R^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} t^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} &: 1/R \leq t \leq 1/2. \end{cases}
\end{align*}
%
Thus
%
\[ |H_R(t)| \lesssim C_p(h) \Big( R \langle Rs \rangle^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} \Big). \]
%
Write
%
\[ T_R f = \sum_{k = 0}^{O(\log R)} T_{R,k} f, \]
%
where
%
\[ T_{R,0} f = \int \tilde{\eta}(Rt) H_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt \]
%
and
%
\[ T_{R,k} f = \int \eta(R t / 2^k) H_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt. \]

% Sum of O(R) terms,
% Bound by |h|_{l^1}
If $\alpha$ is the inverse Fourier transform of $\tilde{\eta}$, then $T_{R,0}$ corresponds to a multiplier operator $m_{R,0}(\sqrt{-\Delta})$, where
%
\[ m_{R,0}(\lambda) = R^{-1} \sum_n h(n/R) \alpha \Big( \frac{\lambda - n}{R} \Big). \]
%
But
%
\[ D^\beta m_{R,0}(\lambda) = R^{-1-\beta} \sum_n h(n/R) D^\beta \alpha \Big( \frac{\lambda - n}{R} \Big), \]
%
so that
%
\[ |D^\beta m_{R,0}(\lambda)| \lesssim_N R^{-\beta} \| h \|_{L^\infty} \langle \lambda/R \rangle^{-N} \lesssim \lambda^{-\beta} \| h \|_{L^\infty}. \]
%
Thus $m_{R,0}$ is a symbol of order zero, uniformly bounded by the $L^\infty$ norm of $h$, and so for $1 < p < \infty$,
%
\[ \| T_{R,0} f \|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim_p \| h \|_{L^\infty} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}. \]
%
A similar analysis gives that for $k > 0$,
%
\[ \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim_p 2^k \| h \|_{L^\infty} \| f \|_{L^p(M)} \]
%
so we could reasonably use this bound for $k \lesssim 1$.

On the other hand, H\"{o}lder's inequality implies a pointwise bound of the form
%
\begin{align*}
    |T_{R,k} f| &\lesssim C_p(h) (R 2^{-k(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)}) (2^k/R)^{1/p} \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k/R} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*}\; dt \right)^{1/p^*}.
\end{align*}
%
Suppose the endpoint local smoothing conjecture held at the particular value $p^*$ we were consider, at all scales, i.e. so that
%
\[ \left\| \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \right\|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \lesssim (2^k/R)^{1/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}(M)} \]
%
where $\alpha_{p^*} = (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*) - 1/p^*$. Then, using the fact that
%
\[ \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}} \lesssim R^{\alpha_{p^*}} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}, \]
%
we conclude that
% d/p^* - (d-1)/2 < 0
%
\begin{align*}
    \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} &\lesssim C_p(h) (R 2^{-k(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} ) (2^k/R) R^{\alpha_{p^*}} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}\\
    &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{\alpha_{p^*}} 2^{k[ 1 - (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*) ]} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}.
%    \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} &\lesssim C_p(h) R^{1/p^* - (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} 2^{-k(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} (2^k / R)^{1/p^*} R^{\alpha_{p^*}} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}\\
%    &\lesssim C_p(h) 2^{k[d/p^* - (d-1)/2]} R^{-1/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}.
\end{align*}
%
% R^a 2^{-ak} <= O(1)
% a log R - ak log 2 <= O(1)
% k >= log_2 R - O(1/a)
% 2^k / R >= 1 / 100000
This bound is summable in $k$, resulting in a bound uniform in $R$, provided that $p \leq 2(d-1)/(d+1)$, and
%
\[ k \geq \frac{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*) - 1/p^*}{(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*) - 1} \log R - O(1) \]


% 2(d-1)/(d-3) <= p^*
% (d-3)/2(d-1) >= 1 - 1/p
% p <= 2(d-1)/(d+1)
%
\[ k \geq \log_2(R) - O(1). \]
%
Thus we are left to analyze values $k$ with $O(1) \leq k \leq \log_2(R)$, which is equivalent, for instance, to analyzing times $100/R \leq |t| \leq 1/100$.

On the other hand, if we \emph{increase} the exponent in the integrability condition $C_p(h)$ by a $\varepsilon$, i.e. assuming the quantity
%
\[ C_{p,\varepsilon}(h) = \left( \int |\widehat{h}(t)|^p (1 + |t|)^{(d-1)(1 - p/2) + \varepsilon} \right)^{1/p} \]
%
is finite, then we have bounds of the form $|H_R(t)| \lesssim R \langle Rs \rangle^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*) - \varepsilon}$, 

then the strategy above leads us to study the wave equation over a very very small set of times, i.e. $100/R \leq |t| \leq R^{-O(\varepsilon)}$.

Let's explore the analysis over these very very small set of times. Fix $\varepsilon > 0$, let $\phi \in C_c^\infty((0,\infty))$ and equal to one for $|t| \lesssim 1$, and consider an operator of the form
%
\[ T_R f = \int \phi( R^\varepsilon t) \left( \sum_{l = -\infty}^\infty R \widehat{h}(R(t + l)) \right) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f. \]
%
Let $a_R$ denote the inverse Fourier transform of $t \mapsto \phi(R^\varepsilon t) ( \sum_l R \widehat{h}(R(t + l)) )$. Then
% u . h_R
\[ a_R(\lambda) = R^{-\varepsilon} \sum_{\omega \in \ZZ} h \left( \frac{\lambda - \omega}{R} \right) \widehat{\phi}(\omega / R^\varepsilon) \]
%
In particular, for $N \geq 0$,
%
\[ D^N a_R(\lambda) = R^{-(N+1) \varepsilon} \sum_{\omega \in \ZZ} h \left( \frac{\lambda - \omega}{R} \right) D^N \widehat{\phi}(\omega / R^\varepsilon). \]
%
Thus we conclude that
%
\[ |D^N a_R(\lambda)| \lesssim_N R^{-N \varepsilon} \| h \|_{L^\infty} \]
%
In particular, if $|\lambda| \sim R$, then $|D^N a_R(\lambda)| \lesssim_N |\lambda|^{-N \varepsilon}$. In particular, if $\psi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ is supported on the annulus $|\lambda| \sim 1$, then the functions $\tilde{a}_R(\lambda) = \psi(\lambda / R) a_R(\lambda)$ uniformly lie in some symbol class $\mathcal{S}^0_\varepsilon(\RR)$, i.e. nonstandard symbols of order zero. We also have
%
\[ |D^N a_R(\lambda)| \lesssim_N R^{-(N + 1)\varepsilon} \left( \sup_{R'} \| \text{Dil}_{R'} h \|_{l^1(\ZZ)} \right), \]
%
which implies that under the assumption that the supremum in the inequality above is finite, then $\tilde{a}_R$ lies unformly in the symbol class $\mathcal{S}^{-\varepsilon}_\varepsilon(\RR)$. In the Euclidean setting, a bounded family of operators in $\mathcal{S}^m_\varepsilon(\RR^d)$ will be uniformly bounded in $L^p(\RR^d)$ for $m = - (1 - \varepsilon) d / 2$, so we should expect the condition is only sufficient if $\varepsilon \geq 1 - 2 / (d+2)$.

On the other hand, for smaller values of $k$, we might be able to get away with localizing, allowing us to reduce to an $L^2$ bound. The operators $T_{R,k}$ are `roughly' self-adjoint (since the wave equation is `roughly self adjoint' because of the time-reversal symmetry). Thus it suffices to prove an $L^p(M) \to L^p(M)$ estimate for these operators. If $f$ is supported on a ball of radius $2^k / R$, then we have
%
\[ \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim (2^k / R)^{d(1/p - 1/2)} \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^2(M)}. \]
%
Probably $L^2$ energy conservation should imply that we should use the estimate
%
\[ \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^2(M)} \leq \int \eta(Rt/2^k) H_R(t) \| f \|_{L^2(M)} \lesssim 2^{k(1-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2))} \| f \|_{L^2(M)}. \]
%
Now using the Sobolev embedding and the fact that $f$ is, roughly speaking, supported at frequencies about $R$, we obtain that if $l = d(1/p - 1/2)$,
% k = 0
% p = 2
% l = ?
% q = p
% 1/2 = 1/p - l/d
% l/d = 1/p - 1/2
% l = d(1/p - 1/2)
\[ \| f \|_{L^2(M)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{l,p}(M)} \lesssim R^{d(1/p - 1/2)} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}. \]
%
Putting these bounds together, we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^p(M)} &\lesssim (2^k / R)^{d(1/p - 1/2)} 2^{k(1 - (d-1)(1/p - 1/2))} R^{d(1/p - 1/2)} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}\\
    &\lesssim 2^{k[ 1/2 + 1/p ]} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}.
\end{align*}
%
Summing over $1 \lesssim k \lesssim \log_2(R)$ gives a bound of the form $R^{1/2 + 1/p} \| f \|_{L^p(M)}$, which is not good enough, so this technique still doesn't help us. On the other hand, if we sum over $k \lesssim (1 - O(\varepsilon)) \log R$ gives a bound of the form $R^{(1 - O(\varepsilon))(1/2 + 1/p)}$ which is also not good enough.

Summing up gives
%
\[ \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \lesssim R^{-1/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)}. \]

Summing up this bound gives uniform bounds in $R \geq 1$. On the other hand, the ednpoint local smoothing conjecture also implies that
%
\[ \left\| \left( \int_{|t| \lesssim 1 / R} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \right\|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \lesssim R^{-1/p^*} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}(M)}, \]

\[ \| T_{R,0} f \|_{L^{p^*}(M)} \lesssim C_p(h) R^{\alpha_{p^*}} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_{p^*}}(M)}. \]

%
as $R \to 0$.

\section{Attempt \# 2: Unsuccessful?}

We break up $T_R f = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty T_{R,k} f$, where
%
\[ T_{R,0} f = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R \widehat{h}(Rt) \rho_0(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt \]
%
and for $k \geq 1$,
%
\[ T_{R,k} f = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R \widehat{h}(Rt) \rho(Rt / 2^k) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt. \]
%
Our goal is to obtain some exponential decay in $k$ so that we can use the triangle inequality to get uniform bounds on the whole operator.

First, let's deal with the $k = 0$ case. Let $m$ be the inverse Fourier transform of $\widehat{h} \cdot \rho_0$ then $T_{R,0} = m \left( \sqrt{-\Delta} / R \right)$. The function $m$ is smooth, i.e. it satisfies bounds of the form
%
\[ |\nabla^N m(\lambda)| \lesssim_{N,M} C_p(h) \langle \lambda \rangle^{-M} \]
%
for all $N$ and $M$. It follows by a manifold version of the H\"{o}rmander-Mikhlin theorem \cite{SeegerSogge} that $\| T_{R,0} f \|_{L^p(M)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(M)}$ for all $1 < p < \infty$, uniformly in $R$, so this part of the operator is relatively trivial to analyze.

Now we deal with the $k > 0$ case. H\"{o}lder's inequality, combined with the trick of first multiplying and dividing by $(1 + |Rt|)^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)}$ implies that
% -(d-1)(p^*/2 - 1)
\begin{align*}
    |T_{R,k} f| &= \left| \int_{-\infty}^\infty R \widehat{h}(Rt) \rho(Rt / 2^k) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt \right|\\
    &\leq R \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} \left( |\widehat{h}(Rt)| (1 + |Rt|)^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \right)^p\; dt \right)^{1/p}\\
    &\quad\quad\quad\left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} \left( |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f| (1 + |Rt|)^{-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \right)^{p^*}\; dt \right)^{1/p^*}\\
    &\lesssim R^{1 - 1/p} 2^{-k(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} C_{p,k}(h) \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*}\; dt \right)^{1/p^*}.
\end{align*}
% -(d-1)(p^*/2 - p^* + 1))
% R^{1 - 1/p} 2^{-k(d-1)(p^* / 2 - 1)}
%
where
%
\[ C_{p,k}(h) = \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k} |\widehat{h}(t)|^p \cdot 2^{k(d-1)(1 - p/2)}\; dt \right)^{1/p} \]
%
Applying the periodicity of the wave equation, for $2^k \geq R$ we have
%
\[ \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k/R} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim (2^k/R)^{1/p^*} \left( \int_{|t| \lesssim 1} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*}. \]
%
If the endpoint local smoothing conjecture held, then we would have
%
\[ \left( \int_{|t| \lesssim 1} |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_p}}, \]
%
where
%
\[ \alpha_p = d(1/2 - 1/p) - 1/2. \]
%
But applying a Sobolev embedding, since $f$ is a sum of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalue $\sim R$, we conclude that
%
\[ \| f \|_{L^{p^*}_{\alpha_p}} \lesssim R^{\alpha_p} \| f \|_{L^p} \]
%
Thus we conclude that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^p} &\lesssim R^{1 - 1/p} 2^{-k(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} (2^k/R)^{1/p^*} R^{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2} C_{p,k}(h) \| f \|_{L^p}\\
    &\lesssim R^{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2} 2^{k[d/p^* -(d-1)/2]} C_{p,k}(h) \| f \|_{L^p}.
\end{align*}
%
Provided that $p < 2d/(d+1)$, this bound is summable in $k$. And provided that $p \geq 2d/(d+1)$, the bound is uniform in $R \geq 1$. This indicates that we're dealing with is `precisely' at the endpoint in some sense.

In particular, if we do these calculations replacing $C_p(h)$ with $C_{p,\varepsilon}(h)$, where
%
\[ C_{p,\varepsilon}(h) = \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( |\widehat{h}(s)| (1 + |s|)^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2) + \varepsilon} \right)^p \right)^{1/p}, \]
%
then for $2d/(d+1) \leq p < 2d/(d+1) + O(\varepsilon)$, we get uniform boundedness in $L^p$ as we vary $R$.
%then for $2d/(d+1) \leq p < 2d/(d + 1 - 2 \varepsilon) =$, we get uniform boundedness on $L^p$.

% 2d/(d+1-2e) - 2d/(d+1) = 2d(d+1) - 2d(d+1 - 2epsilon) / (d+1)(d + 1 - 2epsilon)

% 4d/(d+1)^2 epsilon

If we choose a parameter $l$ such that

%
Putting all these bounds together yields that
%
\[ \| h(\sqrt{-\Delta} / R) f \|_{L^p} \lesssim R^{1 - 1/p} 2^{-k (d-1) (1/2 - 1/p^*)} C_p(h) (2^k / R)^{1/p^*} R^{\alpha_p} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}} \]

The small time parameterix for the half-wave operator, combined with the composition calculus of Fourier integral operators, allows us to write, for $|t| \leq 1$,
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f = T_t f + S^\infty_t f, \]
%
where $S^\infty_t$ is a \emph{smoothing operator}, i.e. an integral operator with
%
\[ S^\infty_t f(x) = \int K(t,x,y) f(y)\; dy, \]
%
where $K \in C^\infty([-1,1] \times S^n \times S^n)$, and where we can locally write
%
\[ T_t f(x) = \int_{\RR^n} a(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(x,y,\xi)} f(y)\; d\xi\; dy \]
% p(x,\xi) = \sqrt{-\Delta}
for some symbol $a \in S^0$, and some symbol $\Phi \in S^1$ satisfying
%
\[ \Phi(x,y,t,\xi) = (x - y) \cdot \xi + t g_y(\xi,\xi) + O(|x - y|^2 |\xi|). \]
%
To calculate the canonical relation of this operator, we look at the principal symbol of the operator $\sqrt{-\Delta}$. If $g$ is the metric of $S^n$, then the principal symbol will be
%
\[ p(x,\xi) = C \left( \sum g_{ij}(x) \xi^i \xi^j \right)^{1/2} = C |\xi| \]
%
for an appropriate constant $C$ (TODO: Do this calculation more precisely). One can calculate (see Remark in Section 4.1 Sogge's book) that the canonical relation of the family of operators $\{ T_t \}$ is given by
%
\[ \mathcal{C} \subset \{ (x,t,\xi,\tau,y,\eta) : (y,\eta) = \phi_t(x,\xi), \tau = p(x,\xi) \}, \]
%
where $t \mapsto \phi_t(x,\xi)$ is the geodesic travelling at a velocity of $2\pi$ which starts at $x$, and travels in the direction given by $\xi$. We claim this canonical relation satisfies the cinematic curvature condition. Indeed, the projections $\Pi_{y,\eta}: \mathcal{C} \to T^* S^n$ and $\Pi_{x,t}: \mathcal{C} \to T^* S^n$ are both submersions, so the Fourier integral operator is nondegenerate. For each pair $(x_0,t_0)$, the cone
%
\[ \mathcal{C}_{x_0,t_0} = \{ (\xi,\tau) : |\xi| = C^{-1} \tau \} \]
%
is an $n$ dimensional hypersurface in $T_{x_0,t_0}^*((-1,1) \times S^n)$, and it is easy to see this hypersurface is curved for all $t$. The endpoint local smoothing conjecture claims that if $f \in L^{p^*}(S^{n-1})$ for precisely the range of $p$ we care about in the radial multiplier conjecture, then $T f \in L^{p^*}_{-\alpha_p}((-1,1) \times S^{n-1})$, where $\alpha_p = n(1/2 - 1/p^*) - 1/2 = n(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2$. In particular, if we assume that Sobolev norms work on $S^n$ the same way they work on $\RR^n$, this means that if $f \in L^{p^*}(S^{n-1})$ has frequency supported on $|\xi| \leq L$, then
%
\[ \| T_R f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)_{\alpha_p}} \lesssim L^{\alpha_p} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)}. \]
%
Thus we see that local smoothing is pretty hopeless in proving the result we need to prove for general $f$.

The only non optimal inequality we applied here was H\"{o}lder's inequality, which would be tight if there exists a non-negative function $\gamma$ such that
%
\[ |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f|^{p^*} (1 + |Rt|)^{-(d-1)\frac{(2-p)}{2(p-1)}} = \gamma(x)^{p^*} |\widehat{h}(Rt)|^p (1 + |Rt|)^{(d-1)(1-p/2)}, \]
%
i.e. where
%
\[ |e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f(x)| = \gamma(x) (1 + |Rt|)^{(d-1) \frac{(2-p)}{2}} |\widehat{h}(Rt)|^{1/p^*}. \]

TODO: Think about why local smoothing is useless. Is the theorem trivial if H\"{o}lder's inequality is applied?

%where $g$ is the Riemmanian metric of $S^n$. In particular, if we work with the coordinates $z_{\pm}$ in the strict upper and lower hemispheres given by
%
%\[ z_{\pm}^{-1}(t_1,\dots,t_n) = (t_1,\dots,t_n, \pm (1-t_1^2 - \dots - t_n^2)^{1/2}), \]
%
%then in coordinates we have
%
%\[ g_y(\xi,\xi) = |\xi|^2 - (1 - |y|^2)^{-1/2} |y \cdot \xi|^2, \]
%
%and so in these coordinates we have the explicit form

%\[ \Phi(x,y,s,\xi) = (x - y) \cdot \xi + t |\xi|^2 - t (1 - |y|^2)^{-1/2} |y \cdot \xi|^2 + O(|x - y|^2 |\xi|). \]

\section{Junk}

Rescaling and applying H\"{o}lder's inequality, we have
%
\begin{align*}
    R \int_0^{2\pi} & \int_{\RR^d} \sum_{k = 0}^\infty w(R s + (2 \pi k) R) a(s,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(x,y,s/R,\xi)}\; d\xi\; ds\\
    &= \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \int_0^{2 \pi R} w(s + (2 \pi k) R) \int_{\RR^d} a(s/R,x,y,\xi) e^{2\ pi i \Phi(x,y,s/R,\xi)}\; d\xi\; ds\\
    &\leq \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \left( \int_0^{2\pi R} |w(s + (2 \pi k) R)|^q\; ds \right)^{1/q} \left( s \right)
\end{align*}


Now suppose that $\| w \|_{L^q(\RR^d, (1 + |x|)^{(d-1)(1 - q/2)})} < \infty$
%
\[ \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{\RR^d} \sum_{k = 0}^\infty b_t(R s + (2 \pi k) R) a(s,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; ds, \]

Let us begin with the qualitative assumption that $h$ is compactly supported. Then, by breaking things up into a finite sum, we may assume that $h$ is supported on $[1/2,2]$. Fix a function $\chi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ equal to one on $[1/2,2]$, and vanishing outside of $[1/4,4]$. Write
%
\[ P_R = \chi \left( \sqrt{-\Delta} / R \right) = \sum \chi(\lambda / R) E_\lambda. \]
%
Then for any function $f \in C^\infty(S^n)$, $T_R f = T_R \{ P_R f \}$. Thus when bounding the behaviour of the operator $T_R$, we may assume inputs are linear combinations of eigenfunctions to $\sqrt{-\Delta}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda \sim R$.

\chapter{Extensions to Non-Periodic Functions}

Suppose that $M$ is a manifold on which the geodesic flow is non-periodic. Can one still establish multiplier theorems in this setting? The analysis of small times still carries across perfectly fine. Even the $L^2$ analysis continues to work, because of the fact that
%
\[ \langle e^{2 \pi i t_0 P} f_{x_0}, e^{2 \pi i t_1 P} f_{x_1} \rangle = \langle e^{2 \pi i (t_0 - t_1)} f_{x_0}, f_{x_1} \rangle, \]
%
and so provided $|t_0 - t_1| \lesssim 1$, we've reduced our analysis to local times. However, if we're to apply Bourgain's interpolation trick, we also have to get some estimates in $L^0$ or $L^1$ so that we can interpolate.

If we write $b(t) = R \widehat{h}(Rt)$, and then consider a decomposition $b(t) = \sum_n b_n(t - n)$, where $\text{supp}(b_n) \subset [-2/3,2/2]$, then
%
\[ \| b_n \|_{L^p[-1,1]} \lesssim n^{-s_p} R^{1 - 1/p - s_p} C_p(h). \]
%
Provided that $p < 2(d-1)/(d+1)$, we have $s_p > 1$, so provided we can show bounds of the form
%
\[ \left\| \int b_n( t - n ) e^{2 \pi i t P} f\; dt \right\|_{L^1(M)} \lesssim_\varepsilon n^\varepsilon R^{s_p + 1/p - 1} \| f \|_{L^1(M)}, \]
%
then we can interpolate, and then apply the triangle inequality. This is tricky though. It works when $M$ is the sphere, because then the result follows by local smoothing and periodicity. But for other manifolds, other tricks are needed. Composing the Fourier integral operator might work, but requires some technical calculations. 

% Time from n to n+1
%   We know that | h^ < t >^{s_p} |_{L^p_t} <= C_p(h)
%
%   So
%       ( int [ R|h^(Rt)| <Rt>^{s_p} ]^p )^{1/p} <= R^{1 - 1/p} C_p(h)
%
%   So if we write b(t) = R h^(Rt), and b(t) = sum b_j(t) where
%   b_j has support on [j,j+1], then
%
%   then
%       ( int [ b_j(t) <Rt>^{s_p} ]^p )^{1/p} <= R^{1 - 1/p} C_p(h)
%
%   If j is not 0 or -1, this quantity is about
% 
%       ( int |b_j(t)|^p )^{1/p} <= n^{-s_p} R^{1 - 1/p - s_p} C_p(h)
% 
%   s_p = (d-1)(1/p - 1/2), so s_p > -1 when
%   (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) > 1 which happens when p < 2(d-1)/(d+1)
%   which is the range we're considering.
%
%   So we just need to show that for inputs that have frequency ~ R
%   and integrals over [n,n+1],
%   | int b(t) e^{2 pi i t P} f |_{L^1_x}
%       << n^{-s_p} R^{1 - 1/p - s_p} | e^{2 pi i t P} f |_{L^1_x L^q_t}
%
%   So as long as we can show
%   | e^{2 pi i t P} f |_{L^1_x L^q_t} <<_eps n^{eps} R^{s_p - (1 - 1/p)} |f|_{L^1}
%   We can sum up.
%
%   Alternatively, if we can show L^p_{s_p - (1 - 1/p)} -> L^1_x L^q_t
%   without the dependence on R that would be fine.
%
%       On the sphere, this can be done using *periodicity*, and
%       local smoothing.
%
%       Maybe on an integrable system, since the Ehrenfast time is better,
%       we can get better control over large times by composition?
%       i.e. since the Ehrenfast time is R, we might get uniform control for |n| <= R
%       Then for n >> R, we need only compose the FIO (n/R) times to get control
%       which probably yields a O(C^{n/R})





\chapter{Are Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian Locally Constant}

Suppose that $f \in C^\infty(M)$, and $\Delta f = - \lambda^2 f$. If $f$ was a function on $\RR^d$, the uncertainty principle would imply that $f$ was locally constant at a scale $1/\lambda$, i.e. such that for any $|x_0| \leq 1/\lambda$,
%
\[ |f(x_0)| \lesssim_N \lambda^d \int |f(x)| w_\lambda(x), \]
%
where $w_\lambda(x) = (1 + \lambda^2 |x|^2 )^{-N}$.

Does an analogous inequality hold for spherical harmonics? Perhaps we can use the Hecke-Funk formula. Namely, if $f \in V_R$, $\phi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ is non-negative, and equal to one on $1/2 \leq t \leq 2$, and
%
\[ P_R(t) = \sum_k \phi( k/R - 1 ) G_k(t), \]
%
then $f = P_R * f$. Experimental evidence (see code in GegenbauerSummationGraph.py) leads us to believe that $P_R$ is concentrated on a $1/R$ neighborhood of $t = 1$, and we should therefore expect to have a bound of the form
%
\[ |f(x)| \lesssim_N R^n \int_{S^n} w_N(R(x \cdot y)) |f(y)|\; dy, \]
%
where $w_N(t) = \langle t \rangle^{-N}$. Can we formally prove this is the case?








\chapter{Uncertainty Principle}

Suppose that $u: \RR^d \to \CC$ is a smooth function, such that
%
\[ \text{supp} \left( \widehat{u} \right) \subset \{ |\xi| \leq R \}. \]
%
Let $B$ be a ball with radius $1/R$, let $\chi_B$ be a smooth bump function adapted to $B$, and consider the function
%
\[ u_B = \chi_B \cdot u. \]
%
Let $c_B = R^{d/p} \| u_B \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ denote the `magnitude' of the function $u_B$, and introduce the normalization $u_B = c_B v_B$. Then
%
\begin{align*}
    \| D^\alpha u_B \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} &\lesssim \sup_{\beta_1 + \beta_2 = \alpha} \| D^{\beta_1} \chi_B \cdot D^{\beta_2} u \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim R^{|\alpha|} \| u_B \|_{L^p(\RR^d)},
\end{align*}
%
and
%
\[ \left( \sum_B R^{-d} c_B^p \right)^{1/p} \lesssim \left( \sum_B \| u_B \|_{L^p}^p \right)^{1/p} \lesssim \| u \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
The Sobolev embedding theorem tell us that
%
\[ \| u_B \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim c_B, \]
%
and more generally,
%
\[ \| D^\alpha u_B \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim R^{|\alpha| + d/p} \| u_B \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
%
But this means that
%
\[ \| D^\alpha v_B \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim R^{|\alpha|}. \]
%
Thus the functions $\{ v_B \}$ are smooth, and adapted to the family of balls $\{ B \}$.







\chapter{Attempt Using Decoupling}

Let us try and attack our problem using decoupling. Fix a function $h: (0,\infty) \to \RR$, which is compactly supported on $\{ 1 < \lambda < 2 \}$, and use this function to induce a family of radial multiplier operators on the sphere $S^d$, of the form
%
\[ T_R f = \sum h(\lambda / R) \langle f, e_\lambda \rangle e_\lambda. \]
%
Our goal is to obtain bounds of the form
%
\[ \sup_{R > 0} \| T_R f \|_{L^p(S^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(S^d)}. \]
%
Without loss of generality, as in the last chapter, because of the support of $h$, for a given $R$, we may assume that our inputs $f$ are a sum of eigenfunctions on the sphere with eigenvalue between $R$ and $2R$. We rewrite
%
\[ T_Rf = \int_{-\infty}^\infty R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt. \]
% We may assume h^ equals one in a neighborhood of the origin. Then
% Sum_{k = 0}^R R h^(Rk)
%
Since we are attempting to obtain bounds in the range that the local smoothing conjecture has been obtained, by the calculations in the last chapter, it suffices to analyze that part of the term above of the form
%
\[ T_Rf = \int_{1/R \lesssim |t| \lesssim 1} R \widehat{h}(Rt) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt. \]
%
%Using the fact that the wave equation is periodic of period one on $S^{d-1}$, we have
%
%\[ T_R f = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} H_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f\; dt, \]
%
%where
%
% P = R
%\[ H_R(t) = R \sum_{l = -\infty}^\infty \widehat{h}(R(t + l)) = \sum_{R < l < 2R} h(l / R) e^{2 \pi i l t}. \]
%
In coordinates, modulo a smoothing operator, whose behaviour is negligible, we can write the kernel of $e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}$ as
%
\[ \int a(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi, \]
%
where $a$ is a symbol of order zero with
%
\[ \text{supp}(a) \subset \{ (x,t,y,\xi): |x - y| \lesssim 1\ \text{and}\ |\xi| \gtrsim 1 \}, \]
%
and $\Phi(t,x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi + t |\xi|_g$. We can thus write the kernel of $T_R f$ as
%
\[ \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \int R \widehat{h}(Rt) a(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi. \]
%
We now decompose $T_R f$ in both frequency and time, writing
%
\[ T_R f = T_R^{\leq 0} + \sum_{k = 1}^{O(\log R)} \sum_{n = 1}^\infty T_{R,k}^{2^n} \]
%
where $T_{R,k}^{\lambda}$ has kernel
%
\[ \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \int \beta(Rt/2^k) R \widehat{h}(Rt) a(x,t,y,\xi) \beta(\xi / \lambda) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dt, \]
%
and $T_R^{\leq 0}$ is supported on $|\xi| \leq 1$, and thus has the right $L^p$ bounds simply by applying the triangle inequality. By the choice of input $f$, we expect the majority of the contribution of the sum the operators $T_{R,k}^n$ should come from $n \approx \log R$. In the last chapter, we were able to obtain uniform bounds in $R$ by summing up $k \lesssim 1$ and $k \gtrsim \log R$, so it suffices to study the operators $T_R^{n,k}$ in the range $1 \lesssim k \lesssim \log R$.

We now try and apply the decoupling result of Beltran, Hickman, and Sogge; if we cover the unit sphere in $\RR^d_\xi$ by $O(\lambda^{-(d-1)/2})$ points $\Theta_\lambda$, consider an appropriate partition of unity $\{ \chi_\lambda^\nu : \nu \in \Theta_\lambda \}$, and thus write
%
\[ T_{R,k}^{\lambda} = \sum T_{R,k}^{\lambda,\nu}, \]
%
where $T_{R,k}^{\lambda,\nu}$ has kernel
%
\begin{align*}
    \int & \int \beta(Rt/2^k) R \widehat{h}(Rt) a(x,t,y,\xi) \beta(\xi / \lambda) \chi_\lambda^\nu(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dt\\
    &= \int R \widehat{h}(Rt) a_{\lambda,\nu,R,k}(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}.
\end{align*}
%
Let us suppose that, using the techniques of their paper, we can show that
%
\[ \| T_{R,k}^\lambda f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)} \lesssim_{p,\varepsilon} \lambda^{\alpha_{p^*} + \varepsilon} \left( \sum_\nu \| T^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k} f \|_{L^{p^*}(\RR^d)}^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*}. \]
%
Thus it suffices to analyze the behaviour of each of the operators $T^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k}$ separately. For each fixed $t$, energy conservation implies that
%
\begin{align*}
    \| T_{R,k}^{\lambda,\nu} f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} &\lesssim \left( \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} R \widehat{h}(Rt)\; dt \right) \| f^\lambda_\nu \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \\
    &\lesssim \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} R \langle Rs \rangle^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p)} \| f^\lambda_\nu \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}\\
    &\lesssim (2^k)^{1 - (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p)} \| f^\lambda_\nu \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}.
\end{align*}
%
Thus $L^2$ orthogonality implies that
%
\[ \left( \sum_\nu \| T^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k} f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2} \lesssim (2^k)^{1 - (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p)} \| f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}. \]
%
On the other hand, to obtain an interpolation at $L^\infty$, we must understand the operator
%
\[ \sup_\nu \| T^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k} f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \]
%
A stationary phase argument shows that, if we write
%
\[ T^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k} f = \int_{|t| \sim 2^k / R} R \widehat{h}(Rt) T^{\lambda,t}_{R,\nu} f, \]
%
then the kernel $K^{\lambda,\nu,t}_{R}$ of $T^{\lambda,\nu,t}_{R}$ satisfies estimates of the form
%
\[ |K^{\lambda,\nu,t}_{R}(x,t;y)| \lesssim_N \frac{\lambda^{(d+1)/2}}{\Big\langle \lambda | \pi_\nu \nabla_\xi \Phi(x,y,t,\nu) | + \lambda^{1/2} | \pi_\nu^\perp \nabla_\xi \Phi(x,y,t,\nu) | \Big\rangle^N}. \]
%
Here we have $\nabla_\xi \Phi(x,y,t,\nu) = (x - y) + t \nu + O(|x - y|)$. Thus we conclude that, for a fixed $x$, this kernel has the majority of it's support on a cap centered at the point $x + t \nu$, with thickness $1/\lambda$ in the direction $\nu$, and thickness $1/\lambda^{1/2}$ in directions tangential to $\nu$. But this implies that the kernel of $K^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k}$ is essentially supported on a $1/\lambda^{1/2}$ neighborhood of the line $\{ t \nu : |t| \sim 2^k/R \}$, and moreover, on that line we have
%
\[ |K^{\lambda,\nu}_{R,k}(x;t\nu)| \lesssim \int_{t - 1/\lambda}^{t + 1/\lambda} R \langle Rs \rangle^{-(d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} \lambda^{(d+1)/2} \; ds \]
%
For $\lambda \geq R$, since $k \gtrsim 1$, and thus $|t| \geq 100/R$ we get that
%
\[ |K^\lambda_{R,\nu}(x;t\nu)| \lesssim \lambda^{-1} R^{1 - (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)} t^{- (d-1)(1/2 - 1/p^*)}. \]
%
These same estimates hold replacing $t \nu$ with $t \nu + v$ for some $v$ perpendicular to $\nu$ with $|v| \leq \lambda^{-1/2}$. Thus we get that
%
\[ \int |K^\lambda_{R,\nu}(x;y)|\; dy \lesssim 2^k/R. \]
%
For $\lambda \leq R$, and $|t| \leq 10/\lambda$, we get that
%
\[ |K^\lambda_{R,\nu}(x;t\nu)| \lesssim \lambda^{(d+1)/2} \]
%
and for $|t| \geq 10/\lambda$, we get that
%
\[ |K^\lambda_{R,\nu}(x;t\nu)| \lesssim \lambda^{(d-1)/2} R^{1 - (d-1)(1/2-1/p^*)} t^{-(d-1)(1/2-1/p^*)}. \]
%
Integrating these results gives that
%
\[ \int |K^\lambda_{R,\nu}(x;y)|\; dy \lesssim 1, \]
%
the same bound as was obtained for $\lambda \geq R$. Thus Schur's Lemma gives
%
\[ \sup_\nu \| T^\lambda_{R,\nu} f \|_{L^\infty} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^\infty}. \]
%
%Using Poisson summation, we can write the kernel of the operator $T^\lambda_{R,\nu}$ as
%
%\begin{align*}
%    \sum_{R < l < 2R} &\int \int h(l/R) e^{2 \pi i l t} a_{\lambda,\nu}(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i \Phi(t,x,y,\xi)}\; d\xi\; dt\\
%    &= \sum_{R < l < 2R} h(l/R) \int \int a_{\lambda,\nu}(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [\Phi(t,x,y,\xi) + t l]}.
    % Main contribution should occur for (x - y) + t xi / |xi| being <= 1/lambda
    % Then the nabla_t { Phi + tl } = |xi| + tl
%\end{align*}
% xi (x - y) + t(|xi| + l)
% The phase here should *always* be nonstationary in the t variable, so let's integrate by parts a bunch of times and see what happens.
%
% = sum_{R < l < 2R} h(l/R) 
%
%The function $H_R$ has decay away from $t = 0$, so to maximize this value we probably want the operator to maximize it's contribution near this value. Since we only care about the supremum over the values $\nu$, an extremizer will likely have $f = f^\lambda_\nu$. But this $f$ has Fourier support on a cap of thickness $\lambda$ and tangential thickness $\lambda^{1/2}$
%
Interpolating gives that
%
\[ \left( \sum \| T^\lambda_{R,\nu} f \|_{L^{p^*}}^{p^*} \right)^{1/p^*} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}, \]
%
and thus that
%
\[ \| T^\lambda_R f \|_{L^{p^*}} \lesssim_\varepsilon \lambda^{\alpha(p^*) + \varepsilon} \| f \|_{L^{p^*}}. \]








\chapter{Trying to Use Hadamard Parametrix}

Let
%
\[ T_R f = \sum_\lambda m(\lambda / R) \langle f, e_\lambda \rangle e_\lambda. \]
%
If we write
%
\[ M(t) = \int_0^\infty m(\lambda) \cos(2 \pi t \lambda)\; d\lambda, \]
%
then the inverse formula implies that
%
\[ m(\lambda / R) = \int M(t) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi \lambda t}{R} \right)\; dt. \]
%
Thus we have
%
\[ T_R f = \int M(t) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi \sqrt{-\Delta} t}{R} \right) f\; dt \]
%
Local smoothing implies that we need only analyze an integral of the form
%
\[ T_R f = R \int \eta(R t) M(R t) \cos \Big( 2 \pi \sqrt{-\Delta} \cdot t \Big) f\; dt, \]
%
where $\eta$ has support on an arbitrarily small, but fixed portion of the origin. Localizing the operator by a partition of unity, and then applying the Hadamard parametrix, we should expect to control the kernel $T_R f$ by a finite sum of functions of the form
%
\[ K_R(x,y) = R \iint \frac{c(x,y) \eta(R t) M(R t)}{|\xi|^\nu} e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot d_g(x,y) + t |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dR, \]
%
where $a$ is smooth and compactly supported, and $d_g$ denotes the geodesic distance on the manifold. Let us perform a frequency decomposition, writing $K_R = K_{R,0} + 2^{k(d - \nu)} \sum_{k = 1}^\infty K_{R,k}$, where
%
\[ K_{R,0}(x,t;y) = R \int M(Rt) \frac{c(x,y) \eta(R t) \psi_0(\xi)}{|\xi|^\nu} e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot d_g(x,y) + t |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dt, \]
%
and for $k \geq 1$,
%
\[ K_{R,k}(x,t;y) = 2^{k(\nu - d)} R \iint \frac{a(x,y) \eta(R t) M(R t) \tilde{\psi}( \xi / 2^k )}{|\xi|^\nu} e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot d_g(x,y) + t |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dt. \]
%
Rescaling, and setting $a_\nu(x,t,y,\xi) =  a(x,y) \eta(t) \tilde{\psi}(\xi) / |\xi|^\nu$ gives that
%
\[ K_{R,k}(x,t;y) = \int M(t) \int a_\nu(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i 2^k (\xi \cdot d_g(x,y) + (t / R) |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dt. \]
%
Similarily,
%
\[ K_{R,0}(x,t;y) = \int M(t) a_{\nu,0}(x,y,t,\xi) e^{2 \pi i (\xi \cdot d_g(x,y) + (t/R) |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dt. \]
%
Our goal is to obtain some $L^p$ estimates on this operator that are summable in $k$, thus obtaining bounds of the form
%
\[ \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^p} \lesssim 2^{k(\nu - d - \varepsilon)} \]
%
for some $\varepsilon > 0$, which hold uniformly in $R$. The operator $T_{R,0}$ should not be an issue since one can just take in absolute values to obtain the required result.

Stationary phase tells us that the majority of the mass of the kernel $K_{R,k}$ should be concentrated on points $(x,t;y)$ where $|d_g(x,y) - t/R| \lesssim 2^{-k}$, a geodesic annulus of radius $t/R$, and thickness $2^{-k}$. If we are to try a decoupling result, let us split this annulus into a family $\Theta_k$ of sectors of aperture $2^{-k/2}$ with the finite itnersection property. We should require a set of sectors $\Theta_{R,k}$ with $\#(\Theta_k) \lesssim 2^{k(d-1)/2}$. If we consider a partition of unity $\{ \chi_\theta \}$ localizing the operator to these sectors, we can therefore write $T_{R,k} = \sum_\theta T_{R,k,\theta}$. Let us suppose a Wolff-type decoupling bound held for this operators, i.e. that
%
\[ \| T_{R,k} f \|_{L^p} \lesssim_\varepsilon 2^{k(\alpha(p) + \varepsilon)} \left( \sum_\theta \| T_{R,k,\theta} f \|_{L^p}^p \right)^{1/p}. \]
%
Let us thus analyze a particular one of these operators $T_{R,k,\theta}$, which has kernel
%
\[ K_{R,k,\theta}(x,t;y) = \iint M(t) a_{\nu,\theta}(x,y,t,\xi) e^{2 \pi i 2^k (\xi \cdot d_g(x,y) + (t/R) |\xi|)}\; d\xi\; dt, \]
%
where $a_{\nu,\theta} = a_\nu \cdot \chi_\theta$. For each $t$, and $x$, nonstationary phase tells us that the mass of the kernel $K_{R,k,\theta}(x,t;\cdot)$ should be concentrated on a cap of long thickness $2^{-k}$ and short thicknesses $2^{-k/2}$, containing in the intersection of the sector $\theta$ and the $2^{-k}$ neighborhood of the annulus of radius $t/R$ centered at $y$. We should expect that on this cap the kernel should have amplitude equal to $O( M(t) 2^{-k(d-1)} )$. Thus we have
%
\[ \| T_{R,k,\theta} f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim C_p(m) 2^{-3k(d+1) / 2} \| f \|_{L^\infty} \]










\chapter{Attempt Using Heo-Nazarov-Seeger Technique}

Suppose $h$ is a radial multiplier with support on $\{ 1 \leq \lambda \leq 2 \}$, and let
%
\[ b(t) = 2 \int_0^\infty h(\lambda) \cos(2 \pi \lambda). \]
%
If $B_R(t) = R \sum_l b(R(t + l))$, our goal is to prove uniform $L^p$ bounds on the radial multiplier operator
%
\[ T_R = \int_1^2 B_R(t) e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}}. \]
%
We may assume our input is a linear combination of eigenfunctions with eigenvalue between $R$ and $2R$. If we reduce to local coordinates, we can write
%
\[ e^{2 \pi i t \sqrt{-\Delta}} f(x) = \int_{\RR^d} a(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i (\phi(x,y,\xi) - t |\xi|_g)} f(y)\; d\xi, \]
%
where $a$ is a compactly supported symbol of order zero, and where $\phi(x,y,\xi) \approx (x - y) \cdot \xi$ (this is only up to a smoothing operator, whose behaviour is irrelevant for the purposes of our argument since for such operator trivial $L^p$ estimates hold). Thus we have
%
\[ T_R f(x) = \int_{\RR^d} \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^2 B_R(t) a(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i (\phi(x,y,\xi) - t)} f(y)\; dt\; dy\; dx. \]
%
Now let $\eta \in \mathcal{S}(\RR^d)$ be a Schwartz function vanishing to high order at the origin, and consider the operator
%
\[ \tilde{T}_R f(x) = \int_{\RR^d} \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^2 B_R(t) a(x,t,y,\xi) \eta( \xi ) e^{2 \pi i (\phi(x,y,\xi) - t |\xi|_g)} f(y)\; dt\; dy\; dx. \]
%
Then $\tilde{T}_R f = T_R \circ $

\[ \left\| \int_{\RR^d} \int_1^2 B_R(t) a(x,t,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i (\phi(x,y,\xi) - t |\xi|_g)} f(y)\; d\xi\; dy\; dt \right\|. \]

\chapter{Seeger: Singular Convolution Operators in $L^p$ Spaces}

Let $m: \RR^d \to \CC$ be the symbol for a Fourier multiplier operator $m(D)$. If the resulting operator $m(D)$ was bounded from $L^p(\RR^d)$ to $L^p(\RR^d)$ with operator norm $A$, then the operator would also be bounded `at all scales'. That is, if we consider a littlewood Paley decomposition, i.e. taking
%
\[ f = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty f_i \]
%
where $\widehat{f_i} = \eta_i \widehat{f}$ is supported on $2^i \leq |\xi| \leq 2^{i+1}$ for $i \geq 1$, and $|\xi| \leq 2$ for $i = 0$, then we would have estimates of the form
%
\begin{equation} \label{piecewiseBound}
    \| m(D) f_i \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f_i \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)},
\end{equation}
%
where the implicit constant is uniform in $i$. The main focus of the paper in question is to determine whether a uniform bound of the form \eqref{piecewiseBound} implies $m(D)$ is bounded. More precisely, is it true that
%
\begin{equation} \label{operatorbound}
    \| m \|_{M^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim_p \sup\nolimits_{i \geq 0} \| m_i \|_{M^p(\RR^d)},
\end{equation}
%
where $m_i = \eta_i m$.

The Hilbert transform $H$ is a Fourier multiplier with symbol $m(\xi) = \text{sgn}(\xi)$. For each $i > 0$, $m_i(\xi) = \eta_i \text{sgn}(\xi)$, so that
%
\[ K_i(x) = \widehat{\eta_i \text{sgn}(\xi)} = 2^i H \eta(2^i x). \]
%
Thus
%
\[ \| K_i \|_{L^1(\RR)} = \| H \eta \|_{L^1(\RR)}. \]
%
TODO

It is clear that \eqref{operatorbound} is true for $p = 2$, since in this case the bound is equivalent to an inequality of the form
%
\[ \| m \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim \sup\nolimits_{i \geq 0} \| m_i \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}, \]
%
which is true because the supports of the symbols $\{ m_i \}$ are almost all pairwise disjoint. On the other hand, \eqref{operatorbound} does not hold when $p = 1$ or $p = \infty$, which makes sense, since Littlewood-Paley runs into all kinds of problems for these values of $p$. Arguing more precisely, the condition would be equivalent to showing that for any $K: \RR^d \to \CC$,
%
\[ \| K \|_{L^1(\RR^d)} \lesssim \sup\nolimits_{i \geq 0} \| K * \widehat{\eta_i} \|_{L^1(\RR^d)}. \]
%
If
%
\[ K_N(x) = \int_{|\xi| \leq 2^N} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi \]
%
is the Dirichlet kernel, then $\| K_N \|_{L^1(\RR)} \sim N$. On the other hand, for $i \leq N-1$, we have $K_N * \widehat{\eta_i} = \widehat{\eta_i}$, so that
%
\[ \| K_N * \widehat{\eta_i} \|_{L^1(\RR)} = \| \widehat{\eta_i} \|_{L^1(\RR)} \lesssim 1. \]
%
For $i \geq N+1$, we have $K_N * \widehat{\eta_i} = 0$, so that
%
\[ \| K_N * \widehat{\eta_i} \|_{L^1(\RR)} = 0 \lesssim 1. \]
%
For $i = N$, we have
%
\[ (K_N * \widehat{\eta_N})(x) = 2^N \int_0^1 \eta(\xi) e^{2 \pi i 2^N (\xi \cdot x)} + \int_1^2 \eta(-\xi) e^{-2 \pi i 2^N (\xi \cdot x)}\; d\xi  \]
%
\[ \int |K_N * \widehat{\eta_i}| \]

whereas one
% 
%
\[ K_N * \widehat{\eta_i} = \begin{cases} \widehat{\eta_i} &: i \lesssim N \\ 0 &: i \gtrsim N \end{cases}, \]
%
and so $\| K_N * \widehat{\eta_i} \|_{L^1(\RR)} \lesssim 1$ uniformly in $N$ and $i$. We can then use Baire category techniques to find a kernel $K$ not in $L^1(\RR)$, but such that $\| K * \eta_i \|_{L^1(\RR)} \lesssim 1$, uniformly in $i$.

The result actually fails for $2 < p < \infty$, due to an examples of Triebel. For simplicity, let's work in $\RR$. If we fix a bump function $\phi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$ supported in $[-1,1]$, and set
%
\[ m_N(\xi) = \sum_{k = N}^{2N} e^{2 \pi i (2^k \xi)} \phi(\xi - 2^k), \]
%
then $m_N(\xi) \eta_i(\xi) = m_{N,i}(\xi)$, where $m_{N,i}(\xi) = e^{2 \pi i (2^k \xi)} \phi(\xi - 2^k)$, and so $K_{N,i}(x) = \widehat{m_{N,i}}(x) = e^{2 \pi i 2^k(x - 2^k)} \widehat{\phi}(x - 2^k)$, hence
%
\[ \| m_{N,i}(D) f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} = \| K_{N,i} * f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \leq \| \widehat{\phi} \|_{L^1(\RR)} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR)}. \]
%
On the other hand, the operator norm of $m_N(D)$ from $L^p(\RR)$ to $L^p(\RR)$ is actually $\gtrsim_p N^{|1/p - 1/2|}$, and thus not bounded uniformly in $N$, so Baire category shows things don't work so well here.

This paper shows that one \emph{can} get uniform bounds assuming an additional, very weak smoothness condition, which rules out the example $m_N$ above. Under the most simple assumptions, if \eqref{piecewiseBound} holds, and $\| m_i \|_{\Lambda^\varepsilon} \lesssim 2^{-ik}$, where $\Lambda^\varepsilon$ is the $\varepsilon$-Lipschitz norm, then $\| m(D) f \|_{L^r(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^r(\RR^d)}$ whenever $|1/r - 1/2| < |1/p - 1/2|$. Under slightly stronger smoothness assumptions, we can actually conclude $\| m(D) f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$.

To prove the result, we rely on Littlewood-Paley theory and the Fefferman-Stein sharp maximal function. Without loss of generality we may assume that $2 < p < \infty$. We will actually show that if for all $i$ and $\omega \geq 0$,
%
\[ \int_{|x| \geq \omega} |K_i(x)|\; dx \leq B (1 + 2^i \omega)^{-\varepsilon}, \]
%
consistent with the fact that, if $m_i$ was smooth, the uncertainty principle would say that $K_i$ would live on a ball of radius $1/2^i$. We will then prove that $\| m(D) f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \leq A \widetilde{\log}(B/A)^{|1/2 - 1/p|}$. Our goal is to show that if
%
\[ S^\# f(x) = \sup_{x \in Q} \fint_Q \left( \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \left| m_i(D) f(y) - \fint_Q m_i(D) f(z)\; dz \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\; dy, \]
%
then $\| S^\# f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim A \widetilde{\log}(B/A)^{1/2 - 1/p} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$. It then follows by Littlewood-Paley theory implies
%
\begin{align*}
    \| m(D) f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} &\lesssim_p \left\| \left( \sum_{k = 0}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}\\
    &\leq \left\| M \left[ \left( \sum_{k = 0}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right] \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}\\
    &\lesssim \left\| S^\# \left( \sum_{k = 0}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}\\
    &\lesssim A \widetilde{\log}(B/A)^{1/2 - 1/p}.
\end{align*}
%
To bound $S^\#$, we linearize using duality, picking $Q_x$ for each $x$, and a family of functions $\chi_i(x,y)$ such that $\left( \sum |\chi_i(x,y)|^2 \right)^{1/2} \leq 1$, such that
%
\[ S^\# f(x) \approx \fint_{Q_x} \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \left( m_i(D) f(y) - \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)\; dz \right) \chi_i(x,y)\; dy. \]
%
Thus $S^\# f = S_1 f + S_2 f$, where if $Q_x$ has sidelength $2^{l(x)}$,
%
\[ S_1 f(x) = \fint_{Q_x} \sum_{|i + l(x)| \leq \tilde\log(B/A)} \left( m_i(D) f(y) - \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)\; dz \right) \chi_i(x,y)\; dy \]
%
and
%
\[ S_2 f(x) = \fint_{Q_x} \sum_{|i + l(x)| \geq \tilde\log(B/A)} \left( m_i(D) f(y) - \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)\; dz \right) \chi_i(x,y)\; dy. \]
%
If $|i + l(x)| \lesssim 1$, then the uncertainty principle tells us that $m_i(D) f$ is roughly constant on squares on radius $Q_x$, up to some small error, so that we should expect
%
\[ \left| m_i(D) f(y) - \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)\; dz \right| \lesssim \left| \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)\; dz \right|. \]
%
Thus it is natural to use the bound, $|S_1 f(x)| \lesssim M(\sum_{i = 0}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2)^{1/2}$, which implies
%
\begin{align*}
    \| S_1 f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} &\lesssim \| M(\sum_{i = 0}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2)^{1/2} \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}\\
    &\lesssim \left\| (\sum_{i = 0}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2 )^{1/2} \right\|_{L^2(\RR^d)}\\
    &= \left( \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \| m_i(D) f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2}
\end{align*}
%
and
%
\begin{align*}
    \| S_1 f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} &\leq \| M(\sum_{|i + l(x)| \leq \tilde{\log}(B/A)}^\infty |m_i(D) f|^2)^{1/2} \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}\\
    &\leq \left\| \left( \sum_{|i + l(x)| \leq \tilde{\log}(B/A)} |m_i(D) f|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}\\
    &\lesssim \tilde{\log}(B/A)^{1/2} \sup_i  \| m_i(D) f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}
\end{align*}
%
Interpolation gives $\| S_1 f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \tilde{\log}(B/A)^{1/2 - 1/p} \| m_i(D) f \|_{L^p_x(l^p_i)}$. But now Littlewood-Paley theory shows that
%
\[ \| m_i(D) f \|_{L^p_x(l^p_i)} \leq A \left( \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \| P_i f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \right)^{1/p} \leq A \left( \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \| P_i f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2} \lesssim A \| f \|_{L^p}. \]
%
Thus $\| S_1 f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim A \tilde{\log}(B/A)^{1/2 - 1/p} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$.

On the other hand, if $i$ is much smaller than $l(x)$, we should expect the error between $m_i(D) f(y)$ and $\fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)\; dz$ to be even smaller, and if $i$ is much bigger, then $m_i(D) f$ is no longer constant at this scale, and so the averages should be small, so $m_i(D) f(x)$ should dominate $\fint_{Q_x} m_i(D) f(z)$. Now since our assumption implues that $\| m(D) f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}$, it is not so difficult to prove that
%
\[ \| S_2 f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim A \| f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \sim A \left\| \left( \sum |P_i f|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^2(\RR^d)}. \]
%
The difficulty is proving $\| S_2 f \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim A \| \left( \sum |P_i f|^{1/2} \right) \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)}$, which we can interpolate into an inequality like above where we can apply Littlewood-Paley theory. To do this we perform another decomposition, writing
%
\[ S_2 f = I f + {II}f \]
%
where
%
\[ If(x) = \fint_{Q_x} \sum_{|i + l(x)| \geq \tilde\log(B/A)} \left( m_i(D) (\mathbf{I}_{2Q_x}f)(y) - \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D)(\mathbf{I}_{2Q_x} f)(z)\; dz \right) \chi_i(x,y)\; dy. \]
%
and
%
\[ If(x) = \fint_{Q_x} \sum_{|i + l(x)| \geq \tilde\log(B/A)} \left( m_i(D) (\mathbf{I}_{(2Q_x)^c}f)(y) - \fint_{Q_x} m_i(D)(\mathbf{I}_{(2Q_x)^c} f)(z)\; dz \right) \chi_i(x,y)\; dy. \]
%
Now
%
\[ \|If \|_{L^\infty} \leq \sup_x \fint_{Q_x} \left( \sum | m_i(D) (\mathbf{I}_{2Q_x} f) |^2 \right)^{1/2}\; dy \leq \sup_x |Q_x|^{-1/2} \left( \sum \| m_i(D) (\mathbf{I}_{2Q_x} f) \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2} \lesssim A |Q_x|^{-1/2} \left( \| \mathbf{I}_{2Q_x} f \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \right)^{1/2} \lesssim A \left( \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \fint_{R_x} |f|^2 \right)^{1/2} \]
