Edit and Send Poll to Advanced Dancers
Organize Timing For Next Semester's Classes
Track Down Keys (Email Kanopy To Ensure We Have Right Number of Keys)



Goal of team - community to learn dance / make dance classes more affordable
	Workshops - More affordable way to have classes with more advanced coaches.
		- We have a really good deal r/n, i.e. the cost of a workshop is about the cost of a private class which is a great price.

	Private Classes are really useful for improving
		- Real advantage comes from sequential private classes (i.e. having a coach that trains you)

		- If you're already taking private classes regularly (i.e. you can afford to do so), the subsidy is nice, but isn't going to really help you all that much.
		- If you can't afford to take private classes, the subsidy is nice, but it would be much more advantageous to have regular workshops than a single private each semester.

	Subsidy is a good last resort, but I think only if we are unable to find a way to make advanced workshops work for advanced dancers.

- Invented in 1920s in New York, Originally Called the Turkey Trot.
	- Funky Music.
	- Exciting
	- Fast.

- Progressive Dance, Move around outside of the room.
	- More steps move you around the floor. That's why it's quick (not the tempo).

- First learn Chasse
	- Quick quick Slow

	- Try that back and forth a little bit.

- Can't get anywhere doing this back and forth, so add in forwards and backwards.
	- Step diagonally, alternate between going forwards and backwards.

- MOST IMPORTANT. Get the Tempo Correct
	- The diagonal steps are slow steps
	- The horizontal steps are quick steps

- Now we connect. Do it first in high give position (little offset, arms bent keep strong).

- Now we connect - lead's right arm right below the shoulder. Left hand connects with right hand of follow.

- Technique: Keep your top strong and steady. Like a duck swimming in water!

- Technique: Outside partner
	If you step forward with your foot between your partner's legs, it's easy to trip over your partner or move far, so the right leg goes outside instead of inside the partner. Go outside when stepping forward (so let your partner go outside when stepping back).
- To get outside partner precisely, step diagonally (not too diagonally) with your chest facing the wall. You'll find you step `underneath yourself'.
	- Not too diagonally. If the leader turns too much away (with feet or with chest) then the leader ends up (escaping from the follow), the follow gets stuck in the armpit, and ends up being dragged in stranglehold across the floor. This is hard to recover from. This is a partner dance - you have to pay attention to your partner's location (both lead and follow).

- Introduce floor directions - dance around the side of the room. Leads should almost always face the wall of whatever side of the room.

- Can go around the floor like this if you cheat a little at the corners

- Lock Steps
- Back Locks

- Tipple Chasse (Just a Chasse in a different direction)

- Pivot 
	- Rocking Practice
	- Then learn steps







- Technique: When in Promenade CBMP (i.e. Foxtrot) Stepping Diagonally Rather Than Forward Will Give Lots of Space For Partner
- During Early Rise / When on Inside of Turn, Let Annabel Take Charge
