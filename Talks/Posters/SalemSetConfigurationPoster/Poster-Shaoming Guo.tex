\large{More specifically: If a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ has large \emph{fractal dimension}, does it contain patterns? The main focus of this project is on the construction of counterexamples: for a given function $f$ with domain $(\mathbb{R}^d)^n$, can we construct large sets $X$ such that there are not distinct points $x_1,\dots,x_n \in X$ such that $f(x_1,\dots,x_n) = 0$, i.e. such that $X$ avoids zeroes of $f$? We often study functions $f$ which vanish on the diagonal $\Delta = \{ (x,\dots,x) : x \in \mathbb{R}^d \}$, which makes it difficult to avoid zeroes if $X$ is `thick', i.e. has large fractal dimension.}

%
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (x_1 - x_2) - (x_2 - x_3)$, then sets avoiding zeroes of $f$ do not contain three term arithmetic progressions.

    \item If $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = |x_1 - x_2|^2 - |x_2 - x_3|^2$, then sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ avoiding zeroes of $f$ do not contain the vertices of any isosceles triangle.
\end{itemize}

Mainly, this project constructs large \emph{Salem sets} avoiding zeroes of \emph{nonlinear} functions. Here are some results taken from (D., 2021):

\begin{thm}
    \hspace{-0.1cm} Suppose $f: (\mathbb{R}^d)^n \to \mathbb{R}^i$ is a submersion. Then we can construct a Salem set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ avoiding solutions to $f$ with $\dim(X) = i / (n - 1/2)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $g: (\mathbb{R}^d)^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}^d$ be smooth, such that $D_{x^k} g = (\partial g_i / \partial x^k_j)$ is an invertible matrix for each $1 \leq k \leq n-1$. If
    %
    \[ f(x^1,\dots,x^n) = x^n - g(x^1,\dots,x^{n-1}), \]
    %
    then we can construct a Salem set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ avoiding solutions to $f$ with $\dim(X) = d / (n - 3/4)$, larger than that guaranteed by Theorem 1.
\end{thm}

For instance, we can use these results to construct, for any smooth $\gamma: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^d$, a Salem set $X \subset [0,1]$ with dimension $4/9$ such that $\gamma(X)$ avoids vertices of isosceles triangles.}

\newpart{Salem Sets: Structure vs. Randomness}

\large{

There are several fractal dimensions, and they differ subtly in the properties they measure:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{Hausdorff dimension} $\dim_{\mathbb{H}}(X)$ of a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ measures the ability to distribute mass onto $X$ in a way that does not concentrate too strongly around individual points.

    \item The \emph{Fourier dimension} $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X)$ of a set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ measures the ability to distribute mass avoiding concentration near families of equally spaced points, i.e. concentration `at a particular frequency', as measured quantitatively through the Fourier transform. %a set $X$ has $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X) > \alpha$ precisely when one can find a probability measure $\mu$ with $\text{supp}(\mu) \subset X$ such that $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \leq |\xi|^{-\alpha/2}$ for all $\xi \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
\end{itemize}

One always has $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X) \leq \dim_{\mathbb{H}}(X)$ for any set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, but the reverse is often \emph{not true} if the set is clustered `near particular frequencies', like if $X$ is a flat surface (clustered near frequencies travelling tangent to the hyperplane), or a Cantor set (clustered near frequencies of the form $3^n$), both sets with Fourier dimension zero. On the other hand, a curved hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has Fourier dimension equal to $d-1$, also it's Hausdorff dimension.

%TODO: Picture of Cantor Set, Hyperplane, Curved Surface

\vspace{0.1cm}

We say a set $X$ is \emph{Salem} if $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X) = \dim_{\mathbb{H}}(X)$. \emph{Random sets} are often almost surely Salem, since pure randomness prevents clustering at frequencies with high probability. But it is \emph{suprisingly difficult} to control the Fourier dimension of sets when one introduces \emph{structure} to sets, which may introduce subtle clustering near particular frequencies. In particular, the relation between \emph{nonlinear structure} and Fourier dimension is especially difficult to understand. For instance, even determining the Fourier dimension of the set $\{ x + x^2 : x \in C \}$, where $C$ is the Cantor set, remains an open problem.

\vspace{0.1cm}

There are many constructions of sets with large \emph{Hausdorff dimension} avoiding zeroes of nonlinear functions $f$ (e.g. M\'{a}th\'{e}, 2017 or Fraser and Pramanik, 2018), but most constructions of large Salem sets avoiding functions $f$ focus on linear functions $f$ (e.g. Shmerkin, 2015 or Liang and Pramanik, 2020). Here we describe techniques to deal with the introduction of nonlinear structure to a random set via \emph{probabilistic concentration inequalities}, and \emph{oscillatory integrals}.}

We construct sets avoiding zeroes via a Cantor-type construction, i.e. iteratively defining sets $\{ X_k \}$ by dissecting cubes (intervals if $d = 1$) at each stage into smaller cubes, and keeping a union of smaller cubes chosen carefully so they have \emph{good Fourier analytic properties}, and \emph{avoid a discretized version of the pattern}, which \emph{discretizes the problem}. \vspace{0.1cm}}

\large{If, at each stage of the construction, we choose a large $N > 0$, subdivide each cube into smaller sidelength $1/N^{1/s}$ cubes, and take $N$ of these cubes from each of the original intervals, then iteration for a fixed $s$ should yield a set with Hausdorff dimension $s$. Since the subdivided set `lives at a scale $1/N^{1/s}$', the uncertainty principle tells us to care about frequencies $|\xi| \lesssim N^{1/s}$. And indeed, obtaining a Salem set reduces to verifying the following exponential sum square root cancellation bound can be obtained:

\begin{lem}
    For arbitrarily large $N > 0$, there exists an $N$ element subset $S$ of $[0,1]^d$ such that for any $\xi \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ with $|\xi| \lesssim N^{1/s}$
    % N = r^{-s}
    % r = N^{-1/s}
    \[ \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x \in S} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x} \right| \lessapprox N^{-1/2}, \]
    %
    and for distinct $y_1,\dots,y_n \in S$, $|f(y_1,\dots,y_n)| \gtrsim N^{-1/s}$ ($S$ contains no `near zeroes').
\end{lem}

Let us illustrate how the problem becomes harder as we \emph{increase $s$}, i.e. we try and construct larger Salem sets. To do this, pick $10 N$ points $\{ x_1, \dots, x_{10N} \}$ uniformly at random from $[0,1]^d$. There are roughly $O(N^n)$ tuples $(y_1,\dots,y_n)$, where each $y_i$ is taken from the points $x_i$. Each tuple has probability $O(N^{-i/s})$ of forming a near zero of $f$, since the zero set of $f$ is a $dn - i$ dimensional hypersurface in $(\mathbb{R}^n)^d$. Thus we expect there to be roughly $O(N^{n-i/s})$ tuples formed from the points $\{ x_i \}$ which give near zeroes.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $s \leq i/n$, we expect no tuples will give near zeroes, so setting $S = \{ x_1, \dots, x_N \}$ will satisfy the contraints of the Lemma with high probability. Easy!

    \item If $s > i/n$, we expect there to be tuples giving near zeroes. So we let $S$ be the set of points from the set $\{ x_i \}$ which remain after \emph{pruning}, i.e. after removing any point $x_i$ which equals $y_n$ for some tuple $(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ forming a near zero of $f$. If $s \leq i/(n-1)$, then we will prune at most $O(N^{n-i/s}) \ll 10 N$ points, which means we can still guarantee $S$ contains $N$ points. For $s > i/(n-1)$, we cannot guarantee $S$ contains any points, so $i/(n-1)$ is the limiting dimension we can expect.
\end{itemize}

For $s \leq i/n$, the selection process above is completely random, and so the square root cancellation property is almost automatic. But the pruning we must perform for $s > i/n$ is \emph{structured}, i.e. it removes points clustered near zeroes of $f$, which may cause subtle problems with the Fourier dimension / square root cancellation.

\newpart{Dealing With Pruning}

\large{
It suffices to show the `pruning inequality'
    %
    \[ \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x_k\ \text{pruned}} e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x_k} \right| \lessapprox N^{-1/2} \]

is true, since the random points exhibit square root cancellation before they are pruned.

\vspace{0.1cm}

For $s \leq i/(n-1/2)$, we can guarantee $O(N^{n-i/s}) = O(N^{1/2})$ points have been pruned, so the pruning inequality follows trivially from the triangle inequality. For $s > i/(n-1/2)$ we work harder. We now assume $f(x) = x^n - g(x^1,\dots,x^{n-1})$ as in Theorem 2, so $i = d$ now.

\vspace{0.1cm}

The left hand side of the pruning bound can be viewed as a very nonlinear function $F_\xi(x) = F_\xi(x_1,\dots,x_{10N})$ of the initial uniformly random points chosen. The theory of \emph{probabilistic concentration inequalities} gives various tools guaranteeing that $|F_\xi(x) - \mathbb{E}[F_\xi(x)]|$ is bounded with high probability provided the maximum `influence' of each variable $x_i$ on $F$ is not too large. Since we remove the points corresponding to the last coordinate of $(y_1,\dots,y_n)$, these points have `a little too much influence', but this can be dealt with because these variables are `linear' in $f$ (because of the extra structure assumed in Theorem 2), so we obtain $|F_\xi(x) - \mathbb{E}[F_\xi(x)]| \lessapprox N^{-1/2}$ with high probability for $s \leq d/(n-1)$.

\vspace{0.1cm}

Finally, we can use some inclusion-exclusion bounds to reduce the study of $\mathbb{E}[F_\xi(x)]$ to an oscillatory integral and apply non-stationary phase. But the inclusion-exclusion bounds obtained only work for $s \leq d/(n-3/4)$ (one must understand the `exclusion' in more detail past this range), which is why Theorem 2 only obtains a Salem set of dimension $d/(n-3/4)$ rather than dimension $d/(n-1)$.

\newpart{What's Next}

\large{Here are some problems to improve the results described in this poster:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can one improve the inclusion-exclusion bounds in the analysis of pruned sets to improve the dimension $d/(n-3/4)$ in Theorem 2 to $d/(n-1)$, the best possible bound we can expect purely via pruning random points.

    \item Is there a nontrivial concentration argument for general $f$ as in Theorem 1?

%    \item Given a Salem set $S$ and a nice function $f: S^n \to \mathbb{R}$, it is possible to construct a large Salem subset $X \subset S$ avoiding zeroes of $f$? In the simplest nontrivial example, $S$ could be a curved hypersurface.

    \item Can we use modern `square root cancellation methods', e.g. decoupling, to construct more structured Salem sets?
\end{itemize}
