\maketitle

I am an analyst, studying problems with techniques taken mainly from harmonic analysis, but also probability theory and incidence geometry. My PhD research, advised by Andreas Seeger, has focused on the study of multiplier operators for eigenfunctions on compact manifolds, through an understanding of the geometry and regularity of wave propagation. I have also solved problems in geometric measure theory, investigating when `structure' occurs in random fractals of large dimension. Both projects raise interesting questions I plan to pursue in my postgraduate work.

During my PhD, my work on multiplier operators has focused on relating $L^p$ bounds for Fourier multiplier operators on $\RR^d$ to $L^p$ bounds for multiplier operators of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on compact manifolds. My main achievement, for $d \geq 4$, and a range of $L^p$ spaces, is a complete characterization of functions whose dilates correspond to a uniformly bounded family of multiplier operators on $L^p(S^d)$. The result implies a `transference principle', that the $L^p$ boundedness of a radial Fourier multiplier operator implies the $L^p$ boundedness of the multiplier operator on $S^d$ given by the same symbol. %; thus $L^p$ bounds `transfer' from $\RR^d$ to $S^d$.
The result for compactly supported multipliers is found in \cite{DensonCharacterization}, with the remaining part of the argument in preparation. \emph{Both the characterization and transference principle are the first of their kind for any $p \neq 2$ and any compact manifold}. More detail about this project can be found in Section \ref{Section1} of this statement.

%
% S^d -> R^d transference principle, but there is no transference principle in the opposite direction. Therefore the problem on the sphere is strictly harder.
%
% Therefore effectively establishing a transference principle in the range under which the theorem is proven.

My work in geometric measure theory focuses on constructing sets of large fractal dimension avoiding point configurations. Before starting my PhD, Malabika Pramanik, Joshua Zahl, and I constructed sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding point configurations \cite{DensonPramanikZahl,DensonThesis}. During my PhD, I combined the methods of that paper with more robust probabilistic machinery to address the more difficult problem of constructing sets with large Fourier dimension avoiding configurations \cite{DensonFourier}. \emph{This method remains the only method of constructing sets of large Fourier dimension avoiding nonlinear configurations, and remains the best method for avoiding general `linear' point configurations when $d > 1$}. This work is discussed further in Section \ref{Section2}.

%  Using techniques of high dimensional probability, I was able to fully recover the Hausdorff bound obtained in \cite{DensonPramanikZahl} in the Fourier dimension setting with the additional of a weak linearity assumption. An example application of the method is, for any smooth curve $c: [0,1] \to \RR^d$, a construction of a subset $X$ of $[0,1]$ of Fourier dimension $0.4$ such that $c(X)$ does not contain three vertices of an isosceles triangle. 

In Section 3, I discuss my plans for future research, emphasizing how my PhD work gives me the tools to succeed in these plans. \emph{These projects include characterizing the $L^p$ boundedness of more general multipliers on compact manifolds, and obtaining $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling bounds for random fractal subsets of $\RR$, among several more exploratory projects involving nodal domains of subelliptic operators, o-minimality, and non-linear relativistic wave equations}.

\section{Multiplier Operators on Euclidean Space and on Manifolds} \label{Section1}

% on recent developments in the characterization of $L^p$ boundedness for radial Fourier multiplier operators and their relation to bounds for multipliers on the sphere, as well as a more detailed discussion of the bounds I was able to obtain for such operators. % This motivates the results I was able to obtain in this setting, which we discuss in more detail at the end of the section.

%Much of my PhD has dealt with the study of bounds for radial Fourier multipliers on $\RR^d$, bounds for multipliers of eigenfunction expansions on compact manifolds, and the relation between such bounds.

\subsection{Radial Fourier Multiplier Operators}

Fourier Multiplier operators have long been central objects of study in harmonic analysis. Such operators $T$ are defined by a function $m: \RR^d \to \CC$, the `multiplier' of $T$, by setting

%
\[ Tf(x) = \int_{\RR^d} m(\xi) \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; dx. \]
%
Of particular interest are the radial Fourier multiplier operators, defined by a radial function $m$. For a function $a: [0,\infty) \to \CC$, we denote the radial multiplier operator given by $m(\xi) = a(|\xi|)$ by $T_a$. Any operator on $\RR^d$ commuting with translations is a Fourier multiplier, and if in addition, the operator commutes with rotates, it is a radial Fourier multiplier operator. %explaining their broad applicability. % Fourier multiplier operator is a radial multiplier, explaining their broad applicability %,  explaining their broad applicability in areas as diverse as partial differential equations, number theory, complex variables, and ergodic theory.

In harmonic analysis, it has proved incredibly profitable to study the boundedness of Fourier multiplier operators with respect to various $L^p$ norms. It seems to be one of the few tractable ways of quantifying the degree to which planar waves interact with one another, thus underpinning all deeper understandings of the Fourier transform. The $L^p$ boundedness of a general multiplier operator became of central interest in the 1950s, brought on by the spur of applications the Calderon-Zygmund school and their contemporaries brought to the theory. Some sufficient conditions and some necessary conditions to ensure boundedness were found. But finding necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee boundedness proved to be an impenetrable problem; %, if not impossible problem.
%Effective characterizations of $L^p$ boundedness are 
such conditions for $L^p$ boundedness are only known in simple cases where $p \in \{ 1, 2, \infty \}$.
%
%
% d(1/p - 1/2) derivatives in L^2
% (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) derivatives in L^p
%
% The multiplier m_t(rho) = chi(rho) e^{-it rho}
%
% Has L^p multiplier norm O( t^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} )
%
% If we take s derivatives of m_t, the answer
% 	1sum of terms of the form chi_k(rho) t^k e^{it rho}
% 	where k <= s. Thus the Fourier transform
%
% 	is equal to k_t(t') = t^k chi_k^( t - t' )
% 	The L^p norm of this is O(t^k).
%
% Thus C_p(m_t) << t^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)}
%
% But the Fourier transform of the (d-1)(1/p - 1/2) + epsilon
% derivative is O( t^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} )
%
% Thus epsilon loss techniques cannot analysis sum_k 2^{-k(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} m_{2^k}(rho)
% 
%
%
%
%The general study of the $L^p$ boundedness of general Fourier multipliers began in the 1960s, brought on by the spur of applications the Calderon-Zygmund school and their contemporaries brought to the theory. 
%But aside from certain rather trivial cases where $p \in \{ 1, 2 , \infty \}$, no necessary and sufficient conditions on an operator's symbol to ensure boundedness on $L^p(\RR^d)$ have been found.
%

It thus came as a surprise when several arguments \cites{GarrigosSeeger,HeoNazarovSeeger,Cladek,KimQuasiradial} recently established necessary and sufficient conditions on a function $a$ for a radial Fourier multiplier operator $T_a$ to be bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$.
%By duality, a Fourier multiplier is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$ if and only if it is bounded on $L^{p'}(\RR^d)$, so it is sufficient to consider the case $1 \leq p \leq 2$.
Consider a decomposition $a(\rho) = \sum a_j( \rho / 2^k)$, where $a_j(\rho) = 0$ for $\rho \not \in [1,2]$. For $1 \leq p \leq 2$, in order for $T_a$ to be bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$, testing by Schwartz functions shows that $\sup_j \| \widehat{m}_j \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} < \infty$ is necessary, where $m_j(\xi) = a_j(|\xi|)$. Garrigos and Seeger \cite{GarrigosSeeger} show this is equivalent to $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$, where
%
\[ C_p(a) = \left( \int_0^\infty \big| \langle t \rangle^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \widehat{a}(t) \big|^p\; dt \right)^{1/p} \quad\text{and}\quad \langle t \rangle = (1 + |t|^2)^{1/2}. \] %\quad\text{and}\quad \alpha(p) = (d-1)(1/p - 1/2). \]
%
%and where $\widehat{a}(t) = \int_0^\infty a(\rho) e^{2 \pi i \rho t}\; dt$ is the \emph{cosine transform} of the function $a$.
% 1/p - 1/2 = 29/36 - 1/2 = 11/36
%Duality implies the boundedness of $T_a$ on $L^p(\RR^d)$ is equivalent to it's boundedness on $L^{p'}(\RR^d)$ when $1/p + 1/p' = 1$, and so for $2 \leq p \leq \infty$ it is natural to define $C_p(a) = C_{p'}(a)$.
Using Bochner-Riesz operators as endpoint examples, it is natural to conjecture $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$ is not only necessary, but also sufficient to guarantee $L^p$ boundedness for $1 < p < {\scriptstyle \frac{2d}{d+1}}$. We call this conjecture the \emph{radial multiplier conjecture}. For radial input functions this conjecture has been resolved by Garrig\'{o}s and Seeger \cite{GarrigosSeeger}, though resolving this conjecture for general inputs is likely far beyond current research techniques, given that it implies the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, and thus also the restriction and Kakeya conjectures. Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} proved the conjecture for $d \geq 4$ and $1 < p < {\scriptstyle \frac{2(d-1)}{d+1}}$. Cladek \cite{Cladek} improved this range for compactly supported $a$ when $d = 4$ and $1 < p < 36/29$, and when $d = 3$ and $1 < p < 13/12$. Also of note is the work of Kim \cite{KimQuasiradial}, who extended \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} to more general `quasi-radial multiplier operators'. Nonetheless, the full conjecture remains unresolved for all $d \geq 2$. %, defined by a Fourier multiplier $m$ which is homogeneous, smooth, and non-vanishing, and whose level sets are hypersurfaces of non-vanishing Gauss curvature. Nonetheless, the full conjecture is not completely resolved for all $d \geq 2$.

Various powerful techniques have recently been developed towards an understanding of the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, such as broad-narrow analysis, decoupling, and the polynomial method. However, these methods are difficult to apply in the radial multiplier conjecture. In these methods, one allows for inequalities to have a multiplicative loss of factors of the form $R^\varepsilon$, where $R$ is the frequency scale of the analysis. This multiplicative loss is negligible since the Bochner-Riesz multipliers are conjectured to be bounded on $L^p$ for an open interval of exponents, and so interpolation-based `$\varepsilon$-removal' methods allow us to remove such factors.
% involving an interpolation between $L^p$ spaces allow us to remove these multiplicative factors.
But an arbitrary multiplier bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$ may not be bounded on $L^q(\RR^d)$ for any $q < p$, so such methods are unavailable in the study of general multipliers, partially explaining the limited range in which the conjecture has currently been verified. \emph{Nonetheless, I have several ideas for improving the range of these conjectures, which I discuss in Section 3.}

\subsection{Multipliers For Spherical Harmonic Expansions on $S^d$}

A theory of multiplier operators analogous to Fourier multiplier operators can be developed on the sphere $S^d$. Roughly speaking, Fourier multiplier operators are operators diagonalized by the planar waves $e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$. Multipliers on $S^d$ are operators diagonalized by the spherical harmonics, i.e. the restrictions to $S^d$ of homogeneous harmonic polynomials on $\RR^{d+1}$. Every function $f \in L^2(S^d)$ can be uniquely expanded as $\sum_{k = 0}^\infty H_k f$, where $H_k f$ is a degree $k$ spherical harmonic, and a multiplier for spherical harmonic expansions on $S^d$ is then an operator defined in terms of a function $a: \NN \to \CC$ given by $S_a = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty a(k) H_k$.
%
%\[ S_a f = \sum\nolimits_{k = 0}^\infty a(k) H_k f. \]
%
%Just as any translation-invariant operator on $\RR^d$ is a Fourier multiplier,
For purposes of brevity, we will call such operators `multiplier operators on $S^d$'. Every rotation invariant operator on $S^d$ is a multiplier operator of this kind. %, and thus such operators arise in diverse applications, including celestial mechanics, physics, and computer graphics.


A natural question is to characterize which functions $a$ give multiplier operators $S_a$ bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, but the fact that the operators are described by a discrete sum makes this problem quite different from the study of radial multipliers on $\RR^d$. A more tractable question is to determine when the operators $S_R = \sum a(k/R) H_k$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, since for large $R > 0$ these operators place more and more emphasis on high-frequency eigenfunctions, and heuristic evidence suggests such eigenfunctions can be understood using the geometrical techniques that have proved so useful to the study of analogous operators on $\RR^d$. \emph{I completely characterized those functions $a$ which give rise to a uniformly bounded family of operators $\{ S_R \}$ on a certain range of $L^p$ spaces, and when $d \geq 4$}.

%one exception is available if we weaken our assumptions, i.e. if we asume that $\sup\nolimits_j C_{p-\varepsilon}(a_j) < \infty$ or if the Besov norm $B^{2,p}_{d(1/p - 1/2) + \varepsilon}$ is finite, and progress has been made in this area. In this case the $\varepsilon$-variant of Besov norm conjecture has been completely resolved when $d = 2$ by Carbery \cite{Carbery}, though the higher dimensional cases remain unsolved.
% q = 2
% alpha > d|1/p - 1/2|


%But most of these techniques involving induction on scales, such as broad-narrow analysis or decoupling, or even basic applications of dyadic pigeonholing, cannot be used in characterizations of $L^p$ bounded multipliers; such methods must allow for a $R^\varepsilon$ or $\log R$ loss in the frequency scale $R$, which is permissible in the analysis of Bochner-Riesz multipliers given they lie in a range of Besov spaces, which allow for an epsilon of room at the dyadic scale when interpolating. But an arbitrary multiplier bounded on $L^p$ does not have such a property, and indeed may not even lie in any of the standard Besov spaces (for instance, consider the radial multipliers with symbol $a_t(\rho) = t^{-(d-1)(1/p-1/2)} \chi(\rho) e^{it \rho}$, which are uniformly bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$).

Classical methods for studying multiplier operators on $S^d$ involve the analysis of special functions and orthogonal polynomials, e.g. in the work of Bonami and Clerc \cite{BonamiClerc}. But in the 1960s, H\"{o}rmander introduced the powerful theory of Fourier integral operators to the study of such operators, which allows one to apply more modern techniques of harmonic analysis. This theory is more robust in other senses, applying to the study of multiplier operators associated with a first order self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator on a compact manifold, which we briefly outline. Given such an operator $P$ on a manifold $M$ with eigenvalues $\Lambda$, every function $f \in L^2(M)$ has an orthogonal decomposition $f = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda} f_\lambda$ where $Pf_\lambda = \lambda f_\lambda$. Given $a: \Lambda \to \CC$, we define $a(P) f = \sum\nolimits_{\lambda \in \Lambda} a(\lambda) f_\lambda$.  We study multiplier operators on $S^d$ by linking them to multiplier operators of a particular pseudodifferential operator $P$ on $S^d$. If $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^d$, then for any spherical harmonic $f$ of degree $k$, $\Delta f = k(k+d-1) f$. Thus if $P = (s_d^2 - \Delta) - s_d$, with $s_d = {\scriptstyle \frac{d-1}{2}}$, then $Pf = kf$ for all degree $k$ spherical harmonics $f$, and so for any function $a: [0,\infty) \to \CC$, $S_a = a(P)$.

H\"{o}rmander's idea to studying the operator $a(P)$ was to use functional calculus to write
%
\[ a(P) = \int \widehat{a}(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
a form of the Fourier inversion formula. The multiplier operators $e^{2 \pi i t P}$, as $t$ varies, give solutions to the half-wave equation $\partial_t = i P$ on $M$. Thus the study of the boundedness of the operator $a(P)$ is connected to the averages of this wave equation on $M$, and in particular, to local smoothing inequalities. % for the wave equation. %In particular, multipliers on $S^d$ are related to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 - \Delta = \alpha^2$ on $S^d$.
%We note that this method also connects the study of multipliers on $S^d$ to radial Fourier multipliers, since we can also write $T_a$ as $a(\sqrt{-\Delta})$, where $\Delta$ is the usual Laplacian on $\RR^d$.

Using this reduction, H\"{o}rmander \cite{HormanderRiesz} proved uniform bounds in $L^p(M)$ for the Bochner-Riesz multipliers $( 1 - P^2 / R^2 )^\delta_+$ on $M$, later significantly improved by Sogge \cites{SoggeSpherical,SoggeRieszMeans} and Seeger and Sogge \cite{SeegerSoggeBochnerRiesz} for multipliers of an operator $P$ satisfying the following assumption:
%
\begin{center}
\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth - 2em}{%
        {\bf Assumption A}: If $p_{\text{prin}}: T^* M \to [0,\infty)$ is the principal symbol of $P$, then for each $x \in M$ the `cosphere' $S_x^* = \{ \xi \in T^*_x M : p_{\text{prin}}(x,\xi) = 1 \}$ has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature.
    }%
}
\end{center}
%
Note that when $P = (s_d^2 - \Delta)^{1/2} - s_d$ on $S^d$, the principal symbol is the Riemannian metric on $T^* S^d$, the cospheres are ellipses, and so Assumption A is satisfied. These bounds are obtained via the method of reducing the problem to $L^2(M) \to L^p(M)$ bounds for spectral projection operators on $M$, a method that allows one to uniformly bound the Bochner-Riesz multipliers on $L^p(M)$ in the Tomas-Stein range. Recently, Kim \cite{KimManifold} adapted Sogge's approach to obtain certain necessary conditions ensuring $a(P)$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$ on the scale of Besov spaces. But these bounds are far from a complete characterization of boundedness; for instance, they do not imply the boundedness of the wave multipliers $(1 + P)^{-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} e^{2 \pi i P}$ on $L^p(M)$. \emph{The main goal of my research project was to find a complete characterizations of boundedness, which would be the first such result in the literature.}.

% $(1 + |t|)^{-(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)} \chi( P ) e^{2 \pi i t P}$ on $L^p(M)$. My goal was

% Fourier transform is chi^( * - t )

% analyze multipliers of an operator $P$ satisfying the following assumption:

%Kim proved that under Assumption A, in the Stein-Tomas range $|1/p - 1/2| > (d+1)^{-1}$, if $\sup_j \| a_j \|_{B_p(\RR)} < \infty$, then the operator $a(P)$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$, thus obtaining an analogue of the result of Lee, Rogers and Seeger in this setting.

% However, there are no results in the literature which show that an operator $a(P)$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$ if $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$, for any $p$ and any manifold $M$. \emph{The main goal of my research project was to remedy this}.`'

\subsection{My Contributions To The Study of Multipliers} \label{ContributionMultipliers}

The main goal of my PhD research into multipliers was to obtain analogues of the arguments of \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger,Cladek,KimQuasiradial} in the setting of compact manifolds, in particular for the operator $P = (s_d^2 - \Delta)^{1/2} - s_d$ on $S^d$ which would characterize multiplier operators for spherical harmonics on $S^d$. I obtained such analogues for a range of different operators $P$ that satisfy Assumption A and the following additional assumption:
%
\begin{center}
\fbox{%
    \parbox{\textwidth - 5em}{%
        {\bf Assumption B}: The eigenvalues of $P$ are contained in an arithmetic progression.
    }%
}
\end{center}
%
All eigenvalues of the operator $P$ above are positive integers, so this assumption is satisfied on $S^d$. The assumption also holds more generally for multipliers on the `rank one symmetric spaces' $\RR \PP^d$, $\CC \PP^d$, $\HH \PP^d$, and $\mathbb{O} \PP^2$. The necessity of Assumption B comes from our inability to understand the large time behavior of the wave equation on compact manifolds precisely enough. \emph{Nonetheless, I discuss in Section 3 potential methods for obtaining results under weaker assumptions}. Under Assumption A and Assumption B, in \cite{DensonCharacterization} I proved a `single scale' analogue of the bound of Heo, Nazarov and Seeger.

\begin{theorem} \cite{DensonCharacterization}
	Suppose $P$ is an elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order one on a compact manifold $M$, and the operator $P$ satisfies Assumptions A and B. Then for a function $a$ with $\text{supp}(a) \subset [1,2]$, and for $1 < p < 2 ({\scriptstyle \frac{d-1}{d+1}})$, uniformly in $R > 0$,
    %
    \[ \sup\nolimits_{R > 0} \| a(P/R) \|_{L^p(M) \to L^p(M)} \sim C_p(a). \]
\end{theorem}

\pagebreak[3]

In a paper to be submitted for publication shortly, I provide further arguments justifying that for an arbitrary function $a$, the operator $a(P)$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$ if $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$, thus obtaining a complete analogue of the argument of \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} for multiplier operators on $S^d$. The argument involves using an $L^\infty$ atomic decomposition à la the decompositions of Chang and Fefferman \cite{ChangFefferman} to control the interactions between different frequency scales. %We have obtained analogues of these inner product estimates, discussed below, and the atomic decomposition method generalizes to an arbitrary compact manifold, and so we expect to submit a paper describing these methods, and obtaining the full method above, shortly.

An important corollary of the above theorem is a \emph{transference principle} between Fourier multiplier operators and multiplier operators on $S^d$. Since the condition $\sup_j C_p(a_j)$ is necessary for $T_a$ to be bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$, we conclude that for $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/d$, if $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$, then the multiplier $a(P)$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$. Thus bounds `transfer' from $\RR^d$ to $S^d$. Aside from the study of Fourier multipliers on $\RR^d$, this is the first transference principle of this kind. \emph{There are no results in the literature for any $p \neq 2$, any other compact manifold $M$, and any operator $P$ which guarantee that $a(P)$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$ if $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$.}

%Another corollary is a characterization of the functions $a$ such that multipliers of the form $\{ a(P/R) : R > 0 \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(M)$. If $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$, then the results above imply that the operators $a(P/R)$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(M)$, because the quantity $\sup_j C_p(a_j)$ changes by at most a constant when we dilate $a$ by a factor of $R$. The converse follows from a classic result of Mitjagin \cite{Mitjagin}.
% which implies that if a family of multipliers of the form $\{ a(P/2^j) : j > 0 \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, and $P$ has principal symbol $p_{\text{prin}}$, then the Fourier multiplier $T$ with symbol $a \circ p_{\text{prin}}$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$. It follows that the operators $a(P/2^j)$ cannot be uniformly bounded on $L^p(M)$ unless $\sup_j C_p(a_j)$ to be finite. But since the quantity $\sup_j C_p(a_j)$ is \emph{scale invariant} (it is unchanged if we dilate $a$ by a factor of $2^j$), the bounds discussed above allow us to conclude that the operators $a(P/2^j)$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(M)$ if and only if $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$ for $|1/p - 1/2| > (d-1)^{-1}$.

Another important corollary is a characterization of the functions $a$ which give convergent eigenfunction expansion in $L^p$, i.e. that a function $a$ satisfies $\lim_{R \to \infty} a(P/R) f = f$ for all $f \in L^p(M)$, where the limit is taken in $L^p(M)$, if and only if $a(0) = 1$ and $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$. This immediately follows from the theorem above by the uniform boundedness principle. \emph{As with the transference principle above, these results are the first of their kind for $p \neq 2$ and any other compact manifold $M$.}

The proof in \cite{DensonCharacterization} is an adaption of the argument of \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} for bounding radial Fourier multiplier operators. That argument involves writing a radial multiplier operator as a convolution $Tf = k * f$. We consider a decomposition $k = \sum k_\tau$ and $f = \sum f_\theta$, where the functions $\{ k_\tau \}$ are supported on disjoint annuli supported at the origin, and the functions $\{ f_\theta \}$ are supported on disjoint cubes, and thus we can write $T f = \sum_{\tau,\theta} k_\tau * f_\theta$. Estimates guarantee that the inner products $\langle k_\tau * f_\theta, k_{\tau'} * f_{\theta'} \rangle$ are negligible unless the annulus of radius $\tau$ centered at $\theta$ is near tangent to the annulus of radius $\tau'$ centered at $\theta'$. These inner product estimates are combined with a 'sparse incidence argument' for counting circle tangencies, which when interpolated with a stopping time argument, yields the required $L^p$ bounds. The main difficulty in adapting this approach is the difficulty in obtaining analogous inner product estimates, and handling the case where $\tau$ is large (i.e. handling the long time behavior of the wave equation). We conclude this discussion by describing the two main techniques I developed to resolve these difficulties.

%    \noindent{\emph{Let $T$ be a radial multiplier. Then we can write $T f = k * f$, where $k$ is the Fourier transform of the symbol of $a$. We write $k = \sum k_\tau$ and $f = \sum f_\theta$, where the functions $\{ k_\tau \}$ are supported on disjoint annuli supported at the origin, and the functions $\{ f_\theta \}$ are supported on disjoint cubes. Then $T f = \sum_{\tau,\theta} k_\tau * f_\theta$. Using the Fourier transform and Bessel functions,  we can justify that the inner product $\langle k_\tau * f_\theta, k_{\tau'} * f_{\theta'} \rangle$ is negligible unless the annulus of radius $\tau$ centered at $\theta$ is near tangent to the annulus of radius $\tau'$ centered at $\theta'$ at some point. Combining this inner product estimate with a `sparse incidence argument' for such annuli, one can show that the $L^2$ norm of a sum $\sum_{(\tau,\theta) \in \mathcal{E}} k_\tau * f_\theta$ is well behaved if $\mathcal{E}$ is a suitably sparse set. Interpolation with a trivial $L^1$ estimate yields an $L^p$ estimate on the sum. Conversely, if the set $\mathcal{E}$ is clustered, then $\sum_{(\tau,\theta) \in \mathcal{E}} k_\tau * f_\theta$ will be concentrated on only a few annuli, and so we can also get good $L^p$ estimates simply using pointwise estimates. But then $\| Tf \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} = \| \sum k_\tau * f_\theta \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ can be estimated, depending on whether a sparse or clustered part of the sum dominates.}}

Let us start with the inner product estimates. A natural approach is to use the Lax-H\"{o}rmander parametrix for the wave equation, which reduces our inner product estimates for small $\tau$ to a bound for certain oscillatory integrals. But the phase of this integral that arises is non-explicit, given in terms of a solution to an eikonal equation on $M$. One novel aapproach I made in \cite{DensonCharacterization} was making the observation that if Assumption A holds, then $P$ gives $M$ an implicit geometric structure, turning it into a \emph{Finsler manifold}. %Finsler manifolds are like Riemannian manifolds, though instead of a smooth choice of inner products being fixed on the tangent spaces of the manifold, in Finsler geometry a smooth choice of strictly convex vector space norms are given on the tangent spaces of the manifold.
The phase of the oscillatory integral occurring from the Lax-H\"{o}rmander parametrix is then directly related to a problem about estimating the length of geodesics on this Finsler manifold, and using the Finsler analogue of the second variation formula, we obtain the required inner product estimates that occur in \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} for small $\tau$. These inner product estimates apply to multipliers of an arbitrary pseudodifferential operator $P$ satisfying Assumption A.

The inner product estimates above are sufficient to obtain bounds for small $\tau$, but for large $\tau$ this approach fails, as the Lax-H\"{o}rmander parametrix breaks down past the injectivity radius of the manifold $M$, preventing us from applying direct analogues of the arguments in \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger}. Similar problems emerge in other approaches to the study of multipliers on manifolds. This was the impetus for Sogge's method, used in \cite{SoggeRieszMeans} and \cite{KimManifold}, of studying Bochner-Riesz multipliers in the Tomas Stein ranges, which reduces the problem to the study of $L^p \to L^2$ bounds for spectral projection operators on $M$. % since various heuristics related to the `Ehrenfast time' imply that such operators should still be amenable to study through oscillatory integrals.
We cannot use this method, since the method initially involves the use of appropriately localized estimates of the form $\| a(P) f \|_{L^p} \lesssim \| a(P) f \|_{L^2}$ in order to effectively apply orthogonality. This is too inefficient for the general multiplier operators we consider since additional regularity on $a$ is necessary to eventually recover $L^p$ bounds from $L^2$ bounds. 
% Sobolev embedding heuristics suggest this inequality incurs a lost of $1/p - 1/2$ derivatives, which is fine for obtaining bounds under the assumption that the functions $a_j$ uniformly have $d(1/p - 1/2)$ derivatives in $L^2$, as in \cite{KimManifold}, but not for $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$, when the functions $a_j$ are only guaranteed to have $(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)$ derivatives in $L^p$.

I was able to work around this problem by reducing the required bounds to certain $L^p_x L^p_t$ estimates for the wave equation on the manifold. Such an argument behaves somewhat like Sogge's spectral projection argument, but does not involve a switch to $L^2$, avoiding the problems with Sogge's approach. The catch is that $L^p_x L^p_t$ estimates for the wave equation, related to the phenomenon of local smoothing on manifolds, are not as well understand as spectral projectors. This is why we must assume the rather strict Assumption B, making such estimates feasible. \emph{In future work I hope investigate ways to weaken Assumption B, and I discuss some feasible scenarios to weaken this assumption in Section 3}.

\section{Configuration Avoidance} \label{Section2}

How large must a set $X \subset \RR^d$ be before it must contain a certain point configuration, such as three points forming a triangle congruent to a given triangle, or four points forming a parallelogram? Problems of this flavor have long been studied in combinatorics, such as when $X$ is restricted to a discrete set such as the grid $\{ 1, \dots, N \}^d$. In the last 50 years, analysts have also begun studying analogous problems for infinite subsets $X \subset \RR^d$, where the size of $X$ is measured via a suitable `fractal dimension', one of various different numerical statistics which measure how `spread out' $X$ is in space. The most common fractal dimension in use is the Hausdorff dimension of a set $X$, but we also consider the Fourier dimension as a refinement of Hausdorff dimension which takes into account more subtle behavior of $X$ related to its correlation with the planar waves $e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$ for $\xi \in \RR^d$. 

Unlike many other problems in harmonic analysis, such as the Kakeya conjecture, we often do not have good expected lower bounds for the dimension at which configurations must appear.
%for the threshold dimension $s_*$ corresponding to a given configuration, such that sets with dimension exceeding $s_*$ must contain a given configuration, and such that sets with dimension less than $s_*$ need not contain a given configuration.
%
%for the threshold at which we mu
%Several definite conjectures exist in this area, such as the \emph{Falconer distance set conjecture}, which predicts that if an arbitrary subset $X$ of $[0,1]^d$ with Hausdorff dimension exceeding $d/2$, then the set of all distances between pairs of points in $X$ must form a subset of $\RR$ with positive Lebesgue measure. But these are far and few between. For most kinds of configurations, the expected lower bound at which we can predict configurations is unknown.
%Several definite conjectures on problems about the \emph{density} of certain point configurations in sets have been raised, such as the Falconer distance problem. %, which asks if an arbitrary subset $X$ of $[0,1]^d$ with \emph{Hausdorff dimension} exceeding $d/2$, then the set of all distances between pairs of points in $X$ must form a set of positive Lebesgue measure.
%But there are relatively few definite conjectures about the dimension a set requires before it must contain \emph{at least one} family of points fitting a certain kind of configuration.
For instance, we do not know for $d > 2$ how large the Hausdorff dimension a set $X \subset \RR^d$ must be before it contains all three vertices of an isosceles triangle, the threshold being somewhere between $d/2$ and $d-1$. Similarly, for a fixed angle $\theta \in (0,\pi)$, we do not know how large the Hausdorff dimension of $X$ must be before it contains three distinct points $A$, $B$, and $C$ which when connected determine an angle $ABC$ equal to $\theta$. Depending on whether $\cos^2 \theta$ is rational or irrational, the results of M\'{a}the \cite{Mathe} and Harangi, Keleti, Kiss, Maga, M\'{a}the, Mattila, and Strenner \cite{Harangi} imply the threshold is respectively, either between $d/4$ and $d-1$, or between $d/8$ and $d-1$. 
% The only case here that is fully resolved is when $\theta \in \{ 0, \pi \}$, or when $\theta = \pi/2$ and $d$ is even: when $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi$, the threshold is $d-1$, when $\theta = \pi/2$, the threshold is between $d/2$ and $\lceil d/2 \rceil$, for $\theta$ such that $\cos^2 \theta \in \QQ$ the threshold is somewhere between $d/4$ and $d-1$, and in all other cases the threshold is somewhere between $d/8$ and $d-1$. These results all follow from the results of \cite{Harangi,Mathe}.
We should not even necessarily expect currently known lower bounds to be the 'correct bounds' in these problems, as we do with other problems in harmonic analysis, such as the restriction conjecture and the Falconer distance problem; until recently, certain results due to {\L}aba and Pramanik \cite{LabaPramanik} seemed to suggest that subsets of $[0,1]$ of Fourier dimension one must necessarily contain an arithmetic progression of length three, but Shmerkin has shown this need not be the case \cite{Shmerkin}.

Given that we do not have good lower bounds with which to make definite conjectures, it is of interest to find sets with large fractal dimension that do not contain certain point configurations. My research in geometric measure theory has so far focused on these constructions, using quantitative methods from high dimensional probability theory.

\subsection{A Review of Fractal Dimension and Configuration Avoidance}

%Let us now be a little more precise, and discuss work on constructing sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding configurations. The Hausdorff dimension of a set can be defined in terms of finite Borel measures on $X$, based on the work of Frostman. The Hausdorff dimension of $X$ is the least upper bound of the quantities $s$ for which there exists a finite measure $\mu$ supported on $X$ such that $\mu(B_r) \lesssim r^s$ for all $r > 0$ and all radius $r$ balls $B_r \subset \RR^d$,  Intuitively, if the condition $\mu(B_r) \lesssim r^s$ holds for a large $s$, then $\mu$ must have mass `spread out' over a larger set, and this is only possible while being supported on $X$ if $X$ itself is spread out. 
%If $\mu$ is a finite Borel measure, and there is $s > 0$ such that $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$ for all $\xi \in \RR^d$, then one can show $\mu(B_r) \lesssim r^{s - \varepsilon}$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$, and so the support of $\mu$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $s$. This motivates us to consider the \emph{Fourier dimension} $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X)$ of a set $X$, which is the least upper bound of the quantities $s$ for which these exists a finite Borel measure $\mu$ supported on $X$ with $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$

%and the Fourier dimension is the least upper bound of $s$ such that there is a measure $\mu$ supported on $X$ with $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$.
%Similarily, if $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$, then $\mu$ cannot be correlated with high frequency waves, which also requires the measure $\mu$ be spread out.

%Remarkably, the minimum dimension required to ensure a configuration exists can depend on the choice of dimension used. The Fourier dimension is always smaller than the Hausdorff dimension, but for many explicit sets $X$ this inequality is strict, with the Fourier dimension somehow measuring slightly more information about how correlated $X$ is with planar waves. This subtle difference can emerge in the study of configurations. For instance, for each $k > 0$, a construction of Keleti \cite{Keleti} shows there exists a set $X \subset [0,1]$ with $\dim_{\mathbb{H}}(X) = 1$ such that for all distinct $x_1,\dots,x_k \in X$, and any integers $a_0,\dots,a_k \in \ZZ$, one has $a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n \neq a_0$. On the other hand, any set $X \subset [0,1]$ with $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X) > 2/k$ must necessarily contain distinct points $x_1,\dots,x_k \in X$ such that for some integers $a_0,\dots,a_k \in \ZZ$, one has $a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n = a_0$.	 %sa result of Rudin \cite{Rudin}.

% x = a
% y = a+b

% w = a+b+c
% y + z = w + x


%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item The most natural dimension in this context is the \emph{Hausdorff dimension} $\dim_{\mathbb{H}}(X)$ of the set $X$, which can be defined as the least upper bound of the quantities $s$ for which there exists a finite Borel measure $\mu$ supported on $X$ such that $\mu(B_r) \lesssim r^s$ for all $r > 0$ and all radius $r$ balls $B_r \subset \RR^d$. Intuitively, if $s$ is large, $\mu$ has mass `spread out' over a larger set, and this is only possible while being supported on $X$ if $X$ itself is spread out.

%	\item If $\mu$ is a finite Borel measure, and there is $s > 0$ such that $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$ for all $\xi \in \RR^d$, then one can show $\mu(B_r) \lesssim r^{s - \varepsilon}$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$, and so the support of $\mu$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $s$. This motivates us to consider the \emph{Fourier dimension} $\dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X)$ of a set $X$, which is the least upper bound of the quantities $s$ for which these exists a finite Borel measure $\mu$ supported on $X$ with $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$. One has $\dim_{\mathbb{H}}(X) \geq \dim_{\mathbb{F}}(X)$, but for many explicit sets $X$ this inequality is strict.
%\end{itemize}

%The Fourier dimension thus, morally speaking, measures how uncorrelated the set $X$ is with the Fourier characters $e_\xi(x) = e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$.

It is natural to define fractal dimension of a set in terms of the properties of measures supported on that set. The Hausdorff dimension of a set $X \subset \RR^d$ is the least upper bound of the quantities $s$ for which there exists a finite Borel measure $\mu$ supported on $X$ which satisfies the `ball condition' that $\mu(B_r) \lesssim r^s$ for all $r > 0$ and all radius $r$ balls $B_r \subset \RR^d$; the Fourier dimension is the least such $s$ for which there exists $\mu$ with the decay estimate $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-s/2}$. Intuitively, for large $s$ the ball condition implies that $\mu$ has mass `spread out', and the Fourier decay also implies this, by forcing $\mu$ to be uncorrelated with the waves $e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$ when $\xi$ is large. The Hausdorff dimension is always larger than the Fourier dimension, but this inequality is often strict, the Fourier decay capturing more subtle information about the set $X$, and this means it is often much harder to construct sets with large Fourier dimension avoiding configurations than sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding configurations.

We consider a model problem for pattern avoidance; given a fixed function $f: (\RR^d)^n \to \RR^m$, we construct sets $X \subset \RR^d$ of large dimension which avoid the zeroes of $f$, in the sense that for any distinct points $x_1,\dots,x_n \in X$, $f(x_1,\dots,x_n) \neq 0$. 
%ask how large must the dimension of a set $X$ be to guarantee that there exists $x_1,\dots,x_n \in X$ such that $f(x_1,\dots,x_n) = 0$. We focus on finding lower bounds for this problem, constructing sets $X$ with large Hausdorff or Fourier dimension such that $X$ avoids the zeroes of $f$, in the sense that for any .
This model has been considered in various contexts:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(A)] If $m = 1$, and $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with rational coefficients, M\'{a}the \cite{Mathe} constructs a set with Hausdorff dimension $d/n$ avoiding the zeroes of $f$.

	\item[(B)] If $f$ is a $C^1$ submersion, Fraser and Pramanik \cite{FraserPramanik} constructs a set with Hausdorff dimension $m/(n-1)$ avoiding the zeroes of $f$. 

	\item[(C)] If $f^{-1}(0)$ has Minkowski dimension at most $s$, together with my Master's Thesis advisors Malabika Pramanik and Joshua Zahl \cite{DensonPramanikZahl}, I constructed sets of Hausdorff dimension $(dn - s)/(n-1)$ avoiding the zeroes of $f$.

	\item[(D)] If $f$ can be factored as $f = g \circ l$, where $l: (\RR^d)^n \to \RR^k$ is a full-rank, rational coefficient linear transformation, and $g: \RR^k \to \RR^m$ is a $C^1$ submersion, then in work with Pramanik and Zahl described in my Master's Thesis \cite{DensonCharacterization}, we constructed sets of Hausdorff dimension $m/k$ avoiding the zeroes of $f$.
\end{itemize}
%
Notice that the above four methods only construct sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding patterns. They say nothing about the Fourier dimension of the sets they construct, which in general is a much harder question, involving a delicate interplay between `randomness' and `structure'. Most `structured' sets have low Fourier dimension, % For instance, the standard middle thirds Cantor set has Fourier dimension zero, because the intervals at stage $n$ of the usual construction of the Cantor set lie on arithmetic progressions of length $1/3^n$, and are thus highly correlated with planar waves of frequency $3^n$.
 and so most methods for constructing sets with large Fourier dimension require making certain `random choices' which on average do not correlate with any particular planar wave. Structure must be added to increase the dimension of the set beyond trivial results, but adding too much structure can lead to high correlation with planar waves, and thus decimate the Fourier dimension of the resulting set. Certain results have been obtained, however, for linear functions $f$:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(E)] If $f(x_1,\dots,x_n) = a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n$ with $\sum a_j = 0$, Pramanik and Liang \cite{PramanikLiang} construct $X \subset [0,1]$ with Fourier dimension $1$ avoiding the zeroes of $f$, generalizing a construction of Shmerkin \cite{Shmerkin}, who proved the result in the special case where $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (x_3 - x_1) - 2 (x_2 - x_1)$, a function detecting arithmetic progressions of length 3.

	\item[(F)] K\"{o}rner constructed subsets $X \subset [0,1]$ with Fourier dimension $(k-1)^{-1}$ such that for any integers $m_0,\dots,m_k$, and any distinct $x_1,\dots,x_k \in X$, $a_0 \neq a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n$.
\end{itemize}
%
The focus on linear functions is natural, since the Fourier transform behaves in a predictable way with respect to linearity, whereas the relation of the Fourier transform with respect to other nonlinear phenomena is much more subtle, and more poorly understood. \emph{The main goal of my research on configurations during my PhD was to push past this linearity, finding constructions of sets with large Fourier dimension avoiding the zeroes of nonlinear functions}.

\subsection{My Contributions To The Study Of Configurations} \label{MyContributionFractals}

It seems more difficult to adapt methods (A) and (D) above to construct sets with positive Fourier dimension, since the constructions involve constructing $X$ at each spatial scale by choosing a good family of intervals, and then considering a large union of translates of the intervals along an arithmetic progression. Such a construction gives intervals correlated with waves of frequency complementing the spacing of the arithmetic progression, and so results in the construction of a set with Fourier dimension zero. On the other hand, methods (B) and (C) involve mostly pigeonholing arguments, so they seem the most likely to be able to be adapted to the Fourier dimension setting. I was able to adapt some of the ideas of these methods to obtain such a result. \emph{In future work, I hope to explore adaptions of methods (A) and (D) to the Fourier dimension by ideas of \cite{Shmerkin}}.

For simplicity, I focused on the case when $m = d$ and when the function $f$ was $C^1$ and full rank, an assumption also made in \cite{FraserPramanik}. Then by the implicit function theorem, after possibly rearranging indices, we can locally write $f(x_1,\dots,x_n) = x_1 - g(x_2,\dots,x_n)$ for a function $g: (\RR^d)^{n-1} \to \RR^d$. In \cite{DensonFourier}, under the assumption that $g$ was a submersion in each variable $x_2,\dots,x_n$, I was able to modify the construction of \cite{FraserPramanik} to obtain Fourier dimension bounds.

\begin{theorem} \cite{DensonFourier}
	Suppose that $g: [0,1]^{d(n-1)} \to \RR^d$ is a function such that for each $k \in \{ 0, \dots, n-2 \}$, the $d \times d$ matrix $D_k g = ( \partial g_i / \partial x_{dk+j} )_{i,j = 1}^d$ is invertible. Then there exists a Salem set $X \subset [0,1]^d$ of dimension $d/(n-3/4)$ such that for all distinct $x_1,\dots,x_n \in X$, $x_1 \neq f(x_2,\dots,x_n)$. If, in addition, $g(x_2,\dots,x_n) = ax_2 + h(x_3,\dots,x_n)$ for some $a \in \QQ$, then there exists a Salem set $X \subset [0,1]^d$ of dimension $d/(n-1)$ such that for all distinct $x_1,\dots,x_n \in X$, $x_1 \neq f(x_2,\dots,x_n)$.
\end{theorem}

As with most of the other approaches discussed above, we construct our sets $X$ via a `Cantor-type construction'. Fix a parameter $\alpha$. We iteratively define a nested family of sets $\{ X_k \}$, each a union of cubes of some fixed length $l_k$, and define $X = \bigcap_k X_k$. The set $X_{k+1}$ is obtained from $X_k$ by partitioning $X_k$ each sidelength $l_k$ cube into $N^d$ sidelength $l_{k+1}$ cubes, where $N \coloneqq l_k / l_{k+1}$, and defining $X_{k+1}$ as a subcollection of these cubes. The construction in \cite{DensonFourier} quite simple: To construct $X_{k+1}$ from $X_k$, we start by taking a set $S$ by taking $\sim N^\alpha$ points uniformly at random from the centers of the sidelength $l_{k+1}$ cubes in the partition of each sidelength $l_k$ cube in $X_k$. Some points from this set will form near zeroes of the function $f$; we let
%
\[ S_{\text{bad}} = \{ x \in S : |f(x,x_2,\dots,x_n)| \leq 10 l_{k+1}\ \text{for some $x_2,\dots,x_n \in S$} \}, \]
%
and define $X_{k+1}$ to be the union of all sidelength $l_{k+1}$ cubes centered at points in $S - S_{\text{bad}}$. The set $X$ will then avoid the zeroes of the function $f$. Provided that $\alpha \leq (nd - s)/(n-1)$, we have with high probability that $\#(S_{\text{bad}}) \ll \#(S)$, and so with high probability, at each stage of the construction $X_k$ is a union of $\sim l_k^{-\alpha}$ cubes of sidelength $\alpha$; it is therefore natural to expect the set $X$ almost surely has Hausdorff dimension $\alpha$, and indeed, in \cite{DensonPramanikZahl} this is shown to be the case. The challenge is to show the construction has good Fourier analytic properties with high prrobability.

Simply counting the number of cubes at each scale is not sufficient to obtain a Fourier dimension bound. One observation made in \cite{DensonFourier} is that the core requirement is a square root cancellation bound. More precisely, if we denote the centers of the sidelength $l_k$ cubes forming $X_k$ by $\{ x_1,\dots,x_M \}$, and if for all $1 \lesssim |\xi| \lesssim N$ the square root cancellation bound
%
\begin{equation} \label{squareRootCancellation}
	\left| \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j = 1}^M e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x_j} \right| \lessapprox M^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
%
holds at all scales, then the resulting set $X$ will have Fourier dimension agreeing with its Hausdorff dimension. Indeed, consider the probability measure $\mu_k = M^{-1} \sum_{j = 1}^M \chi_j$ supported on $X_k$, where $\chi_j$ is a smooth bump function adapted to the cube centered at $x_j$. Then for $|\xi| \lesssim 1/l_k$, since $M \sim l_k^{-\alpha}$ with high probability, \eqref{squareRootCancellation} implies that $|\widehat{\mu}_k| \lessapprox M^{-1/2} \lesssim |\xi|^{-\alpha/2}$. On the other hand, the uncertainty principle implies that $\widehat{\mu}_k$ decays rapidly for $|\xi| \gtrsim 1/l_k$, and so $\widehat{\mu}_k$ has the appropriate Fourier decay required. Taking weak limits of the measures $\{ \mu_k \}$, we find that $|\widehat{\mu}(\xi)| \lesssim |\xi|^{-\alpha/2}$ has the right Fourier decay to justify that $X$ has Fourier dimension $\alpha$ with high probability.

We obtain the required square root cancellation bounds using the theory of \emph{concentration of measure} from high dimensional probability theory, which determines when a sum of random variables has square root cancellation away from the mean with high probability. If we are taking a sum of independent random variables, often Hoeffding's inequality gives sharp concentration bounds. But in our construction, the random points $\{ x_1, \dots, x_M \}$ are not chosen independently from one another; the points in the initial set $S$ are independent, but not the points in the set $S - S_{\text{bad}}$. There are certain standard tools to handle this problem, such as McDiarmid or Azuma's inequality, though applied directly in this setting they only guarantee a Fourier decay with $\alpha = d/n$ rather than the larger rate $\alpha = d/(n-1)$. In \cite{DensonFourier}, I found a novel way to interlace Hoeffding and McDiarmid's inequality to ensure square root cancellation away from the mean occurs with high probability for the larger decay rate.

The final problem is then to show that the mean of $M^{-1} \sum e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x_j}$ has square root cancellation. This proved to be the most inefficient aspect of the argument. We can write the mean as an oscillatory integral, though in $M$ variables, and so usual techniques in the theory of oscillatory integrals fail to handle this bound since they are usually \emph{dimension dependent}, and we need uniform bounds in $M$. Instead, I was able to use an inclusion exclusion argument, together with a Whitney decomposition of the thickened zero set of the function $f$ to obtain the required bounds. This is the least optimal part of the argument, and is the main reason a Fourier dimension of $d/(n-3/4)$ is obtained in general rather than $d/(n-1)$; however, if $f$ satisfies a weak linearity a slight modification of the random construction ensures that the mean of $M^{-1} \sum e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x_j}$ is always zero, yielding the large Fourier dimension bound $d/(n-1)$ in this case. %\emph{I am interested in determining whether techniques in the theory can yield the dimension $d/(n-1)$ bound in general, though I do not believe this is a good project for the immediate future given the current techniques available at the time.}%, though I  do not think this is a good research project to pursue immediately given the availability of techniques available at the time.}

\section{Future Lines of Research} \label{Section3}

In this section, I discuss three plans for future projects in detail which I strongly believe should produce reliable results in the near future. Afterwards, we conclude with some more exploratory projects.

%% One obstruction to this generalization at a `single frequency scale' is obtaining control of iterates of a pseudodifferential operator on $M$ called the `return operator'. Another obstruction when 'combining frequency scales' is an endpoint refinement of the local smoothing inequality for the wave equation on $M$. %to handle combining dyadic scales together.
%I am also interested of obtaining bounds on manifolds whose geodesic flow has well-controlled dynamical properties, such as forming an integrable system. Related to my work in geometric measure theory, I hope to apply the probabilistic methods I exploited in the construction of sets of large Fourier dimension to construct random fractals which exhibit good $l^2L^p$ decoupling properties. And I am interested in determining the interrelation of patterns with the study of multipliers on manifolds, in particular studying Falconer distance problems on Riemannian manifolds to local smoothing phenomena for the wave equation on manifolds. A more detailed justification for the potential of these projects can be found in Section 3 of this statement.

%The remaining sections of this summary provides context and describes the results I have obtained during my PhD in further detail, finishing with a further elaboration of future work and it's feasibility given the tools I have gained from my previous work.

%Section 3 will discuss my plans for future research from these two projects.

%Given the context from the previous two sections, we finish this summary by describing in more detail several problems I believe may be accessible given the techniques I have used to solve previous problems.

\subsection{Extending The Range of Endpoint Radial Multiplier Bounds}

At the beginning of Section 1, we discussed the radial multiplier conjecture. Recall that the conjecture stated a Fourier multiplier $T_a$ was bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$ if and only if $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$, where $a(\rho) = \sum a_j(2^{-j} \rho)$ is a dyadic decomposition of $a$, and the quantities $C_p$ are weighted $L^p$ norms of the Fourier transform of $a$. In that section we discussed that no methods involving an `$\varepsilon$ loss' can be used in this conjecture, because of the inability to use certain interpolation arguments. However, if we weaken the conjecture to allow for an $\varepsilon$ of room, we can allow for this loss. Namely, such methods may apply to prove that a Fourier multiplier $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$ if $\sup_j C_{p - \varepsilon}(a_j) < \infty$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$. I hope to pursue whether more modern techniques in restriction theory, such as decoupling and polynomial partitioning, can be used to prove such bounds, especially in the case $d = 2$ in which no such results are known. Below I describe several potential methods that may yield improved bounds.

One possible direction is suggested by several results on `weighted estimates of fractal type' for extension operators, such as the work of Du and Zhang \cite{DuZhang} and Ortiz \cite{Ortiz}, the latter of which directly involves counting tangencies of annuli as in \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger}. These estimates are morally dual to the `sparse incidence bounds' discussed in Section 1.2. Thus finding analogues of `sparse decompositions' in this dual setting may allow one to apply the techniques from these papers to achieve improved bounds.

%Finding a dual argument to the sparsity bounds used in recent characterization of boundedness for radial Fourier multipliers also allows us to prove results directly in the range $2 \leq p \leq \infty$. This allows for us to use certain multilinear to linear arguments to prove bounds. In particular, I believe one may be able to use work on the $k$-linear restriction conjecture to the cone, such as by Barcel\'{o} \cite{Barcelo}, Wolff \cite{Wolff}, Ou and Wang \cite{OuWang}, Beltran and Saari \cite{BeltranSaari}, and Gao, Liu, Miao and Xi \cite{GaoLiuMiaoXi}, to obtain new results.

Another direction is suggested recent work of Zahl \cite{ZahlLieSphere}, who uses a line-sphere correspondence developed in early doctoral work of Sophus Lie to translate problems about counting circle tangencies in $\RR^3$ to counting incidences of complex lines on a quadric surface in $\CC^3$ which can be identified with the Heisenberg group. These lines satisfy the Wolff axiom, and so it might be hoped that techniques from Kakeya theory in $\RR^3$ might be adapted in the `sparse setting' to yield better estimates than were obtained by \cite{Cladek}. When $d \neq 3$, the Lie-Sphere correspondence can still be used, mapping spheres in $\RR^d$ to points in a quadric surface $Q$ in $\PP^{d+2}$. Two circles which intersect tangentially map to two points orthogonal with respect to a bilinear form $B$ on $\RR^{d+3}$. The problem is thus reduced to counting pairs of orthogonal vectors, which is certainly not as well studied as incidences of lines, though projection arguments can reduce the problem to counting incidences between points and hyperplanes.

\subsection{Multipliers Associated With Periodic Geodesic Flow}

The results I discussed in Section \ref{Section2} for multiplier operators on $S^d$ generalized to multipliers of an arbitrary first order, elliptic pseudodifferential operator $P$ on a compact manifold $M$, provided that $P$ satisfied Assumptions A and B of that section. Assumption A relates to the curvature of the principal symbol of $P$, and this assumption cannot really be weakened without significantly changing the character of the results. On the other hand, Assumption B arises as an artifact of the methods of our proof. We can likely obtain similar bounds while weakening this assumptions; for instance, Kim \cite{KimManifold} obtained bounds on the scale of Besov spaces only under Assumption A.

It is likely very difficult that we can complete remove Assumption B using current research methods while still recovering the results of \cite{DensonCharacterization}. This limitation follows from our current inability to understand the large time behavior of wave equations on compact manifolds precisely enough. If we were able to follow the method of \cite{DensonCharacterization}, which reduced the large time argument to a smoothing inequality for the wave equation, then the results of that paper would follow for another operator $P$ if we could prove
%
\begin{equation} \label{smoothingbound}
	\left\| \left( \int_k^{k+1} |e^{2 \pi i t P} f|^{p'}\; dt \right)^{1/p'} \right\|_{L^{p'}(M)} \lesssim k^\delta \| f \|_{L^p_{d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/p'}(M)}
\end{equation}
%
for some $\delta < d(1/p - 1/2) - 1/2$.

If $P$ satisfies assumption $B$, then after rescaling, we may assume without loss of generality that all eigenvalues of $P$ are integers, so that $e^{2 \pi i k P} = I$ is the identity for all $k$, and then \eqref{smoothingbound} holds with $\delta = 0$ for all $|1/p - 1/2| > (d-1)^{-1}$ by the local smoothing inequality of Lee and Seeger \cite{LeeSeeger}. Whether this bound is true in other contexts remains unknown. The next simplest case to consider would be when the operator $P$ has the property that $e^{2 \pi i k P}$ is \emph{close} to the identity for all $k$. This happens precisely when the \emph{Hamiltonian flow} on $T^* M$ given by the vector field $H = ( \partial p_{\text{prin}} / \partial \xi , - \partial p_{\text{prin}} / \partial x)$ is periodic, where $p_{\text{prin}}$ is the principal symbol of $P$. Indeed, results of Colin de Verdi\'{e}re \cite{ColinDeVerdiere} related to the theory of propagation of singularities of Fourier integral operators then tell us that the operator $R = e^{2 \pi i P}$ is a pseudodifferential operator of order zero, and its principal symbol is related to an invariant of the flow known as the Maslov index. The operator has been studied a little by spectral theorists, and there it is known as the \emph{return operator}. If we are able to justify bounds of the form
%
\[ \| R^k f \|_{L^p} \lesssim k^\delta \| f \|_{L^p}, \]
%
or a frequency localized variation of this bound, then the local smoothing inequality of Lee and Seeger yields \eqref{smoothingbound}. Such bounds are of interest since they cover all the operators $P = \sqrt{-\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold with periodic geodesic flow. They are even of interest on the sphere, since our method only allows us to tell when multipliers of the form $a( P/R )$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, where $P = \sqrt{ ( {\scriptstyle \frac{d-1}{2}} )^2 - \Delta }$ whereas these bounds would allow us to tell when the multipliers $a \big( \sqrt{-\Delta} / R \big)$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$.

If such a project is successful, it then becomes of interest to determine whether one can obtain such bounds on manifolds whose geodesic flow has well-controlled dynamical properties, for instance, forming an integrable dynamical system; One model class of such integrable systems are the ellipsoids, or more generally, the convex surfaces of revolution. Results of Colin de Verdière \cite{VerdiereIntegrable}, which prove these manifolds are quantum completely integrable, may help in this case, allowing one to reduce the study of $\sqrt{-\Delta}$ to a family of commuting pseudodifferential operators with integer spectrum.

%It is a classic heuristic that the \emph{smoothness} of the multiplier defining an operator determines it's $L^p$ boundedness. The bound $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$ can be viewed in some sense as such a condition, but is not equivalent to the usual norms that measure smoothness, the Sobolev, Besov, or Triebel-Lizorkin norm. However, it is true that $\| a \|_{A_p(\RR)} \lesssim C_p(a) \lesssim \| a \|_{B_p(\RR)}$, where
%
%\[ A_p(\RR) \coloneqq B_{p,\infty}^{(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)}(\RR)\quad \text{and}\quad B_p(\RR) \coloneqq B_{2,p}^{d(1/p - 1/2)}(\RR). \]
%
%Thus $C_p(a) < \infty$ is slightly stronger condition than control over $(d-1)(1/p - 1/2)$ derivatives of $a$ in $L^p(\RR^d)$, but weaker than control over $d(1/p - 1/2)$ derivatives in $L^2(\RR^d)$. One could conjecture that for $1 < p < 2d/(d+1)$, the operator $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$ if $\sup_j \| a_j \|_{B_p(\RR)} < \infty$. This conjecture only gives necessary, not sufficient, conditions for boundedness, but might be more accessible to current techniques. Indeed, this weaker conjecture has been verified by Lee, Rogers, and Seeger \cite{LeeRogersSeeger} to be true for all $d \geq 2$ in the larger Stein-Tomas range $1 < p < 2 {\scriptstyle \left( \frac{d+1}{d+3} \right)}$.

\subsection{Subpolynomial Decoupling On Random Fractals}

One major development in harmonic analysis in the past decade has been a greater understanding of the phenomenon of \emph{decoupling}, or \emph{Wolff-type estimates}. Given a family of almost disjoint subsets $\mathcal{E}_\delta$ of $\RR^d$ parameterized by $\delta > 0$, $L^p(l^2)$ decoupling discusses bounds of the form
%
\[ \Big\| \sum f_j \Big\|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \leq D_p(\delta) \Big( \sum\nolimits_j \| f_j \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^2 \Big)^{1/2}, \]
%
where the Fourier transforms of the functions $f_j$ are supported on distinct subsets of $\mathcal{E}_\delta$, and $D_p(\delta)$ denotes the best constant under which this equation holds for all such $\{ f_j \}$. After \cite{DemeterBook}, we say a \emph{subpolynomial decoupling inequality} results when one can prove that $D_p(\delta) \lesssim_\varepsilon (1/\delta)^{\varepsilon}$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$.%  or the stronger logarithmic bound $D_p(\delta) \lesssim \log(\delta)$ and other variants of this form.

Much work has been carried out for $d \geq 2$, when the sets $\mathcal{E}_\delta$ are $\delta \times \delta^{1/2}$ caps associated with partitions of neighborhoods of curves and surfaces, and the decoupling inequalities are obtained by virtue of curvature and torsion properties. But the analysis of decoupling on \emph{fractal sets} is still poorly understood. Consider a sequence of integers $n(i)$, and a set $X$ obtained from a Cantor-like construction $\{ X_i \}$ as in Section \ref{MyContributionFractals}, where $X_i$ is a union of a family of cubes $\mathcal{Q}_i$ with some fixed sidelength $\delta \coloneqq \delta_i$. We let $\mathcal{E}_\delta = \{ Q \cap C_{i + n(i)} : Q \in \mathcal{Q}_i \}$, and ask for which Cantor type constructions $\{ X_i \}$ and for which sequences $\{ n(i) \}$ do we obtain a subpolynomial decoupling inequality for the families $\{ \mathcal{E}_\delta \}$.

Some analysis has been done in this setting, but no subpolynomial decoupling bounds have been established for any fractal set. Chang, de Dios Pont, Greenfeld, Jamneshan, Li, and Madrid have obtain such results for self-similar Cantor sets with good numerical properties \cite{ChangJaumeGreenfeldJamneshanLiMadrid}, but none of the bounds obtained give subpolynomial decoupling inequalities in the above sense. Decoupling inequalities for random fractal sets have been obtained by {\L}aba and Wang \cite{LabaWang}, see also {\L}aba \cite{Laba2}; these are also not subpolynomial decoupling inequalities, but the bounds they obtained were sufficient for their applications to the study of $L^p \to L^2$ fractal restriction bounds. In fact, in the range of $p$ they were considering, subpolynomial decoupling is not possible; one can see using the local constancy property and Khintchine type heuristics that if $X$ is chosen sufficiently randomly, and $\# \mathcal{Q}_i \gtrsim \delta_i^{-s}$ for each $i$, then subpolynomial $L^p(l^2)$ decoupling is impossible for any choice of $\{ n(i) \}$ unless $2 \leq p \leq 2d/s$. Unlike for curves and surfaces, it is unclear what the canonical `scale' of the problem is; decoupling for curves and surfaces is possible because the $\delta \times \delta^{1/2}$ caps along these shapes point in different directions. But it is unclear what the canonical choice of $\{ n(i) \}$ should be so that the sets $C_{i + n(i)}$ do not interact significantly.

I believe the techniques related to my results in \cite{DensonFourier} can be applied to obtaining random decoupling inequalities. Methods from the theory of concentration of measure have been applied by Bourgain \cite{Bourgain} and Talagrand \cite{Talagrand} in order to prove the existence of $\Lambda(p)$ sets, in particular, the method of majorizing measures and selection processes. One might view $\Lambda(p)$ sets as a kind of discrete variant of sets upon which decoupling bounds hold, so it is likely to believe these methods generalize to the continuous setting. Using these methods, I hope to obtain an analogue of the proof of $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling for the paraboloid found in \cite{BourgainDemeterStudyGuide}, i.e. establishing an analogue of multilinear Kakeya for the sets $\mathcal{E}_\delta$, and then applying an induction on scales to obtain a subpolynomial fractal decoupling inequality.

\subsection{More Exploratory Projects}

We now discuss some exploratory projects, whose methodology is not quite as clearly defined:\vspace{0.3em}

{\bf Bounds On Nodal Sets For Sub Laplacians} Let $M^d$ be a compact Riemannian manifold, possibly with boundary, and consider an eigenfunction $e_\lambda$ to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, i.e. satisfying $\Delta e_\lambda = \lambda e_\lambda$. It is an interesting problem to consider asymptotic properties of the \emph{nodal domains} of $e_\lambda$, i.e. the connected components of the complement of the zero set of $e_\lambda$. Recently in \cite{EswarathasanLetrouit}, Eswarathasan and Letrouit extended classical methods in the theory of nodal domains to study analogous sets for nodal sets associated with \emph{sub-elliptic} operators, connected components of the complement of the zero set to an eigenfunction to a sums of squares operators of the form $- \sum X_i^* X_i$, where $\{ X_i \}$ are vector fields satisfying H\"{o}rmander's vector field condition. In particular, Eswarathasan and Letrouit prove upper bounds on the number of such connected components, prove a nodal domain cannot contain a ball of suitably large radius, and obtain Yau-type bounds on the Hausdorff measure of the zero set.

In \cite{GeorgievMukherjee}, Georgiev and Mukherjee showed a converse of the results of \cite{EswarathasanLetrouit} in the setting of Laplace operators, in particular showing that a nodal domain \emph{must} contain a ball of suitably large radius. The results involve a use of \emph{stochastic diffusions}, i.e. stochastic processes related to Brownian motion. It is a natural question whether such methods can be used to prove analogous results in the sub-elliptic setting. One problem with such an approach is that stochastic diffusions are related to \emph{elliptic} differential operators like the Laplacian, and so one must find a more general class of stochastic processes associated with \emph{subelliptic} operators.

%{\bf Fourier Dimension of High Codimension Hypersurfaces Via Extremizer Methods}: A curved hypersurface in $\RR^d$ has Fourier dimension $d-1$. On the other hand, the Fourier dimension of higher codimension hypersurfaces in $\RR^d$ is unknown; stationary-phase methods bound the Fourier decay of smooth measures, but it is unknown if such decay is best possible among all measures, even for non-degenerate curves in $\RR^3$; in that case smooth measures decay at a rate of $|\xi|^{-2/3}$, but it is difficult to rule out the existence of non-smooth measures decaying at a faster rate. A potential solution may lie in the theory of extremizers. Indeed, there are many such results in the area that characterize the smoothness of extremizers. If we are able to obtain such results for Fourier decay, we can rule out non-smooth fast decaying measures, and thus find the best possible Fourier decay of measures on surfaces.

%In addition, I am also interested in exploring whether methods for obtaining endpoint estimates for linear radial Fourier multipliers discussed in Section 2 can be used in the setting of \emph{bilinear radial Fourier multipliers}, combining time-frequency methods from recent work by Bernicot and Grafakos \cite{BernicotGrafakos} and Liu and Wang \cite{LiuWang} on the bilinear Bochner-Riesz problem.

%In the near future, I hope to generalize the bounds obtained in \cite{DensonCharacterization} to the more general setting of multipliers associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds with periodic geodesic flow. A single scale obstruction to this generalization is  obtaining control over iterates of a pseudodifferential operator on $M$ called the `return operator'.

{\bf Vector Field Methods}: My PhD work has focused on the regularity of linear wave equations, but recently, I have become interested in studying the long time behavior of nonlinear wave equations. The `vector field method' has long proved a key tool in this setting, capturing the dispersive nature of waves using vector fields to capture approximate symmetries of a problem. Recently, Ifrim and Tataru \cite{IfrimTataruWaterWaves} have developed a `wave packet testing' method complementing the vector field method, to obtain global control on various dispersive equations. I am interested in testing these methods in new problems, such as sharp decay estimates for the wave-equation on Schwarzschild spacetimes with dynamic backgrounds.

Notably, Ifrim and Tataru's methods have not been applied to wave equations on black-hole spacetimes. For some time, obtaining sharp decay estimates to the wave-equation on high-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetimes proved difficult, until resolved by Schlue \cite{Schlue}. But Schlue's method does not apply to spacetimes with dynamic backgrounds, which introduce nonlinearity to the problem. I am interested in investigating whether Ifrim and Tataru's methods can be applied in this setting.

{\bf Analysis of Highly Degenerate Oscillatory Integrals via o-Minimality}: Together with Johnsrude, Sandberg, and de Oliveira Andrade, I recently wrote a study guide on the recent use of `o-minimality' in a paper of Basu, Guo, Zhang, and Zorin-Kranich \cite{BasuGuoZhangZorinKranich} to the study of oscillatory integrals, which we plan to put onto the arXiv shortly. The method gives optimal decay for highly degenerate oscillatory integrals with an algebraic phase. I hope to find new applications of this theory in the study of Fourier integral operators. One application may lie in the study of convolution operators on highly degenerate algebraic Lie groups, from which arise oscillatory integrals with a degenerate phase.

\subsection{Radial Multiplier Bounds And `Fractal Weighted Estimates'}

The main proof of the radial Fourier multiplier estimates in \cites{HeoNazarovSeeger,Cladek,KimQuasiradial} discussed in Section \ref{ContributionMultipliers} involves a `density decomposition arguments'. Roughly speaking, this involves proving bounds on quantities of the form
%
\[ \big\| \sum\nolimits_{(\tau,\theta) \in \mathcal{E}} k_\tau * f_\theta \big\|_{L^2(\RR^d)} \lesssim u^a \Big( \sum\nolimits_{(\tau,\theta) \in \mathcal{E}} \| k_\tau * f_\theta \|_{L^2(\RR^d)}^2 \Big)^{1/2}, \]
%
where $\mathcal{E}$ is a `sparse' discrete set such that $\#\{ \mathcal{E} \cap B_r \} \leq u r$ for all balls $B_r \subset \RR^{1+d}$ of sufficiently small radius $r$. One can then apply interpolation and a `density decomposition' argument to get suitable $L^p$ estimates for $|1/p - 1/2| > a$.

There are several techniques in the literature 

The discrete problem above is related to a `fractal weighted estimate' for the extension operator $E$ associated with the cone in $\RR^{1+d}$. Say a weight $w: \RR^{1+d} \to [0,\infty)$ is $\alpha$ dimensional if $w(B_r) \leq u r^\alpha$ for some $u > 0$ and all balls $B_r$. Then the discrete problem above is equivalent to showing that if $w$ is an $1$-dimensional weight, then 
%
\[ \left\| \int w(x,t) Ef(x,t)\; dt \right\|_{L^p(\RR^{d+1})} \]

Recently several results I have seen various results in the literature on various problems apply to a `dual' version of the bounds above. Namely, given the extension operator $E$ associated with a hypersurface $\Sigma$ of $\RR^{1+d}$, $L^2(\Sigma) \to L^2(\RR^{d+1}, w)$ bounds are obtained for the extension operator under the assumption that the weight function $w: \RR^{d+1} \to [0,\infty)$ is `$\alpha$-dimensional' for some $\alpha \in (0,d+1]$, which means $w(B_r) \lesssim r^\alpha$ for all balls $B_r$ and some $\alpha \in (0,d+1]$. We can view this problem as bounding the $L^2 \to L^2$ operator norm of the operator $Tf = w^{1/2} Ef$, whose dual is the operator $T^*g = R( w^{1/2} g)$, where $R$ is the restriction operator to $\Sigma$.

 then the Schr\"{o}dinger propogators $\{ e^{it \Delta} \}$ satisfy $\| e^{it \Delta} f \|_{L^2(B_R,w)} \lessapprox R^{\frac{\alpha}{2(d+1)}} \| f \|_{L^2}$

 In the theory of restriction, Du, Li, Wang, and


In particular, BLAH has done work on fractal weighted estimates for the extension problem on the parabola, and BLAH has done work on fractal wiehgted estimates for the wave equation

\subsection{Relations Between Fourier Multipliers and Zonal Multipliers}

One connection which explains why analogues to the bounds for radial Fourier multipliers might be found in the study of zonal multipliers is that both classes of operators are related to the Laplace operator on their respective spaces. Namely, if $f$ is a distribution on $\RR^d$, and $\Delta f = - \lambda^2 f$, then $f$ has Fourier support on the sphere of radius $\lambda$ centered at the origin, and so $T_a f = a(\lambda) f$. Similarly, if $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^d$, and $\Delta f = - \lambda(\lambda+d-1)$, then $f$ is a spherical harmonic of degree $\lambda$, and so $Z_a f = a(\lambda) f$.
%If $f$ is a distribution on $\RR^d$ and the support of it's Fourier transform lies on the sphere of radius $k$ about the origin, then $\Delta f = - k^2 f$ and $T_a f = a(k) f$.
%Thus $T_a$ and $\Delta$ have the same eigenfunctions.
%If the Fourier transform of a tempered distribution $f$ is supported on the sphere $\{ \xi : |\xi| = R \}$, then it follows from the Fourier inversion formula that $\Delta f = - 4 \pi^2 R^2 f$.
%This essentially follows because then $f$ is a superposition of the planar waves $e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$ with $|\xi| = R$, and $\Delta e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x} = - 4\pi^2 R^2 f$.
%But for the same such $f$, if $T_a$ is a radial Fourier multiplier, then $T_a f = a(R) f$. Thus a radial Fourier multiplier has the same eigenfunctions of the Laplacian.
%Similarly, if $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^d$, and $f$ is a spherical harmonic of degree $k$, then $\Delta f = - k(k+d-1) f$, and $Z_a f = a(k) f$.
Using the notation of functional calculus, we can thus write $T_a = a \big( \sqrt{-\Delta} \big)$ and $Z_a = a \big( \sqrt{ \alpha^2 - \Delta} \big)$, where $\alpha = (d-1)/2$, and now the resemblance is clear. In the rest of this section, we let $P = \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \Delta}$, and let $a(P/R)$ denote the zonal multiplier with symbol $a(\cdot/R)$.

On the other hand, unlike the planar waves $e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$, it is difficult to understand what a general spherical harmonic might look. Dilation symmetries on $\RR^d$ tell us high frequency planar waves are just the dilates of low frequency planar waves; on the other hand, $S^d$ has no dilation symmetries, and high degree spherical harmonics need not look anything like low degree spherical harmonics. This could be alarming, because the transference principle we hope to prove implies a result related to dilation on $S^d$; namely, if the Fourier multiplier $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$, then the Fourier multipliers $T_{a,R}$ with symbols $a(\cdot/R)$ are all uniformly bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$, and thus the transference principle we hope to prove shows that the zonal multipliers $a(P/R)$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$. Because of the lack of dilation symmetry on $S^d$, the behavior of the operators $a(P/R)$ might change as $R$ varies, which is discouraging.
 %Moreover, the eigenvalues of $\Delta$ on $S^d$ are discrete, whereas the eigenvalues of $\Delta$ on $\RR^d$ range over $(-\infty,0]$. This is discouraging, since the condition $\sup_j C_p(a_j)$ exploited controls the \emph{smoothness} of the function $a$, a property that should be irrelevant to zonal multipliers, given that only discrete values of the symbol are required in the definition of the operator. We should therefore not expect to find a complete characterization for zonal multipliers. % using the methods which bound radial Fourier multipliers.

%However, various heuristics tell us the operators $- \Delta / R^2$ on $\RR^d$ and $(\alpha^2 - \Delta) / R^2$ on $S^d$ behave asymptotically like one another as $R \to \infty$. Thus we might hope to find a completely characterization of the functions $a$ such that the operators $\{ Z_{a,R} \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, where $Z_{a,R} = a( P/R )$ is the zonal multiplier operator with symbol $a_R(\rho) = a( \rho / R)$. In fact, a classic result of Mitjagin \cite{Mitjagin} proves that if the operators $\{ Z_{a,R} \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, then $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$. Thus, if we could show that $\sup_j C_p(a_j) < \infty$ implies that the operators $\{ Z_{a,R} \}$ are uniformly bounded, then we would have obtained a \emph{transference principle} for such operators, that an operator $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$ if and only if the operators $\{ Z_{a,R} \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$. %and in particular that the operators $\{ Z_{a,R} \}$ are uniformly bounded if and only if $\sup_j C_p(a_j)$ is finite.

Fortunately, whatever differences the operators $a(P/R)$ have as $R$ varies are not as relevant to the study of $L^p$ boundedness as one might at first think. This is because zonal multipliers only fail to be bounded on $L^p(S^d)$ because of `high frequency behavior'; a zonal multiplier whose symbol is compactly supported is bounded on all of the $L^p$ spaces. And there are various heuristics that tell us that the Laplacian on $S^d$ begins to behave more and more similar to the Laplacian on $\RR^d$ when restricted to high frequency eigenfunctions. For instance, on $S^d$, the operator $P/R$ can be written as $\sqrt{ \alpha^2/R + \Delta_R }$, where $\Delta_R$ is the Laplacian associated with the metric $g_R = R^2 g$ on $S^d$. As $R \to \infty$, the metric $g_R$ gives $S^d$ less curvature and more volume, and so we might imagine that, as $R \to \infty$, the operator $P/R$ behaves more and more like $\sqrt{-\Delta}$ on $\RR^d$, and thus multipliers of $P/R$ behave more and more like radial Fourier multipliers, i.e. we might imagine that the equation $T_a = \lim_{R \to \infty} a(P/R)$ holds in a certain heuristic sense.

The last equation also leads us to believe that if the operators $a(P/R)$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(S^d)$, then $T_a$ is bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$. This is true for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, a classical transference result of Mitjagin \cite{Mitjagin}. On the other hand, the transference principle we prove is more unusual: the boundedness of a limit point need not necessitate uniform bounds on the limiting sequence. This might explain why the principle is more difficult to prove. Indeed, Mitjagin's argument
% Moreover, recent results on the failure of the Kakeya conjecture in three dimensional manifolds with non-constant sectional curvature \cite{DaiGongGuoZhang} provide weak evidence that the range of $L^p$ spaces to which inequality \eqref{upperboundmainresult} can be obtained may be more sensitive to the geometry of a manifold $M$ than the range of $L^p$ spaces under which \eqref{mitjagininequalityforlaplacian} holds. Obtaining bounds of the form \eqref{upperboundmainresult} therefore requires a more subtle analysis than required to obtain bounds of the form \eqref{mitjagininequalityforlaplacian}.
%In this setting, we were able to prove this transference principle on $S^d$ for all $d \geq 4$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/(d-1)$,the same range of parameters under which the results of \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} holds. A result like this is significant, since no analogous result has been proved on any other compact manifold.
Mitjagin's argument generalizes to show that for any compact manifold $M$, and any elliptic, self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator $P$, the uniform boundedness of the multiplier operators $a(P/R)$ on $L^p(M)$ implies the boundedness of the Fourier multiplier $T$ on $L^p(\RR^d)$ whose symbol is given by the principal symbol of $P$. Until our new transference principle, no analogous transference principle has been shown for any $P$ and any exponent $p \neq 2$, excluding trivial cases, nor any characterization of functions $a$ such that the operators $\{ a(P/R) \}$ are uniformly bounded on $L^p(M)$ for any $p \neq 2$.

\subsection{Bounding Band Limited Zonal Multipliers}

To discuss the techniques I developed which lead to the aforementioned characterization, let us begin by summarizing the rough methodology by which the arguments in \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger,Cladek,KimQuasiradial} are able to obtain these bounds. We  begin by describing the \emph{band limited} part of the argument:

\pagebreak[3]

  \medskip
  \hangindent0.5em
  \hangafter=0
    \noindent{\emph{Take a decomposition $T_a = \sum_{j \in \ZZ} T_j$, where $T_j$ is the multiplier operator with symbol $a_j( \cdot / 2^j)$. Our goal is the band limited bound $\| T_j f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$, uniformly in $j$ % The advantage of this decomposition is that we may assume the inputs and outputs of the operator $T_j$ are band limited and thus we can apply various and heuristics related to the uncertainty principle.
    We then write $T_j f = k * f$, where $k$ is the Fourier transform of $a_j(\cdot / 2^j)$. We then write $k = \sum k_\tau$ and $f = \sum f_\theta$, where the functions $\{ k_\tau \}$ are supported on disjoint thickness $2^{-j}$ annuli, and the functions $\{ f_\theta \}$ are supported on disjoint side length $2^{-k}$ cubes, then $T_j f = \sum_{\tau,\theta} k_\tau * f_\theta$. Using the fact that the Fourier transform is unitary, that the function $f$ is band limited, and some Bessel function estimates, one can argue that the inner product $\langle k_\tau * f_\theta, k_{\tau'} * f_{\theta'} \rangle$ is negligible unless the annulus of radius $\tau$ centered at $\theta$ is near tangent to the annulus of radius $\tau'$ centered at $\theta'$.

Conversely, if the set $\mathcal{E}$ is clustered, then $\sum_{(\tau,\theta) \in \mathcal{E}} k_\tau * f_\theta$ will be concentrated on only a few annuli, and so we can also get good $L^p$ estimates. But then we can estimate $\| Tf \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} = \| \sum k_\tau * f_\theta \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ by either approach, depending on whether a sparse part of the sum dominates, or whether a clustered part of the sum dominates.

\noindent My paper \cite{DensonCharacterization} proves an analogue of this argument for zonal multiplier operators on $S^d$ for $d \geq 4$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/(d-1)$, in particular, obtaining the aforementioned transference principle in this range.

Giving that the argument above exploits convolution on $\RR^d$, one might expect that we might use `zonal convolution' in our argument, i.e. an analogue of convolution on $S^d$. It is likely one can use this approach to obtain $L^p$ bounds under assumptions on the integrability of the zonal convolution kernel. However, the lack of a dilation symmetry on $S^d$ means that the zonal convolution kernel for $a(P/R)$ is likely unrelated to the convolution kernel for $a(P)$ as $R$ varies, so based on our previous discussion it is likely difficult to obtain a transference principle using this technique. Instead, we follow an approach due to H\"{o}rmander BLAH, successfully used in several other problems on manifolds BLAH, and use the Fourier inversion formula to write

\[ Z_j f = \int_{-\infty}^\infty 2^j \widehat{a}_j( 2^j t ) e^{2 \pi i t P} f\; dt, \]
%
where $P = \sqrt{ \alpha^2 - \Delta }$ is as above, and $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ are the wave propagator operators which, as $t$ varies, give solutions to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 = \Delta - \alpha^2$ with zero velocity initial conditions, or equivalently, solutions to $\partial_t = P$, the `half-wave equation'. Given a general input $f$, we perform a decomposition analogous to the method above, writing $f = \sum f_\theta$ and $T_j = \sum T_\tau$, where the functions $\{ f_\theta \}$ are supported on disjoint sets of diameter $2^{-k}$, and $T_\tau = \int b_\tau(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt$, where $2^j \widehat{a}_j( 2^j t ) = \sum_\tau b_\tau(t)$ for a family of functions $\{ b_\tau \}$ is supported on disjoint side length $2^{-j}$ intervals. We can thus write $T_j f = \sum T_\tau f_\theta$.

The behavior of the wave equation is closely tied to the behavior of geodesics on $S^d$. In particular, for high frequency inputs we have a near explicit representation of the wave propagator operators for $|t| < 1/2$, in a coordinate system, by an oscillatory integral
%
\[ (e^{2 \pi i t P} f)(x) \approx \int_{\RR^d} a(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi|_y ]} f(y)\; d\xi\; dy,  \]
%
where $a$ is a symbol of order $0$, $|\xi|_y = (\sum g^{jk}(y) \xi_j \xi_k)^{1/2}$ is obtained from the Riemannian metric of $S^d$, and $\phi$ solves the eikonal equation $| (\nabla_x \phi)(x,y,\xi) |_x = |\xi|_y$ subject to the constraint that $\phi(x,y,\xi) = 0$ for $(x - y) \cdot \xi = 0$.

Oscillatory integral representations of the operators $\{ e^{2 \pi i t P} \}$ \emph{can} be obtained for $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ simply by the fact they form a semigroup, and so for $n-1 \leq t < n$ we can write $e^{2 \pi i t P} = ( e^{2 \pi i (t / n) P} )^n$ as the composition of $n$ oscillatory integrals. The theory of phase reduction for Fourier integral operators can help us reduce this composition, but it is difficult to control this quantity quantitatively.

simply by the fact that they are obtained by repeated compositions of the propogators with $|t| < 1/2$, and qualitative understanding of their behavior can be understand from the general theory of \emph{Fourier integral operators}, but obtaining good control on $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ for large $t$ becomes difficult.

Using this oscillatory integral representation and the stationary phase formula, we can obtain a substitute for the Bessel estimates used in the original argument, justifying that $\langle T_\tau f_\theta, T_{\tau'} f_{\theta'} \rangle$ is negligible unless the geodesic annulus of radius $\tau$ and center $\theta$ is near tangent to the geodesic annulus of radius $\tau'$ and center $\theta'$, provided that $\tau$ is bounded away from $1$. Here we use the stationary phase formula to obtain good bounds on the oscillatory integrals that emerge. However, one subtlety is showing that, restricted to values in $|\xi| = 1$, the critical points of the function $\phi(x,y,\cdot)$ are appropriately non-degenerate. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to the study of the eikonal equation, one can identify the quantity $\phi(x,y,\xi)$ with the signed distance from the hyperplane $\{ x' : (x' - y) \cdot \xi = 0 \}$ to the point $x$ with respect to the Riemannian metric. I came up with a geometric argument involving the second variation formula for geodesics, which justifies that the function $\phi$ has only two stationary points, and each is non-degenerate, with the Hessian at each point having magnitude proportional to $d_g(x,y)^{d-1}$.

After this, the argument for radial Fourier multipliers generalizes quite directly to the case of $S^d$, since the incidence properties required for annuli on $\RR^d$ are roughly analogous to the properties of geodesic annuli on $S^d$.


% this method likely leads to a condition on the different dyadic functions $a_j$ which depends on a $j$ in a rather difficult to understand way, reflecting the lack of a dilation symmetry on the manifold. For similar reasons, 

%. A general zonal multiplier $Z_a$ can be decomposed as $\sum_j Z_j$ simply by decomposing it's symbol $a(\lambda) = \sum a_j( \lambda / 2^j )$, and letting $Z_j$ be the zonal multiplier with symbol $a_j( \cdot / 2^k )$. There is an analogue of convolution on the sphere, called zonal convolution, and so we could write $Z_j$ in terms of this convolution, and decompose as above into pieces supported on different annuli. However, the zonal convolution kernel of an operator does not behave well under dilation of the symbol of the operator (a manifestation of the fact $S^d$ does not have a family of dilation symmetries) so the condition we would need to finish our argument would likely involve rather non explicit assumptions about the various functions $\{ a_j \}$. Instead, we directly use the Fourier transform of $a_j$, which scales under dilations.

%We are able to use this by using the Fourier inversion formula and the functional calculus to write
%
%\[ Z_j = \int_{-\infty}^\infty 2^k \widehat{a}_j( 2^k t ) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt, \]
%
%where $P = \sqrt{ \alpha^2 - \Delta }$ is as above, and $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ are the wave propagator operators which, as $t$ varies, give solutions to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 = \Delta - \alpha^2$ with zero velocity initial conditions, or equivalently, solutions to $\partial_t = P$, the `half-wave equation'. The behavior of this wave equation is closely tied to the behavior of geodesics on $S^d$. In particular, we have a close to explicit representation of the wave propagator operators for $t$ having magnitude smaller than $2\pi$ times the \emph{injectivity radius} on $S^d$, i.e. for $|t| < 1/2$. That is, we can consider the \emph{Lax parametrix} to write the wave propagators, in an arbitrary coordinate system for $S^d$, as an oscillatory symbol
%
%\[ (e^{2 \pi i t P} f)(x) = \int_{\RR^d} a(t,x,y,\xi) e^{2 \pi i [ \phi(x,y,\xi) + t |\xi|_y ]} f(y)\; d\xi\; dy,  \]
%
%where $a$ is a symbol of order $0$, $|\xi|_y = \sqrt{ g^{jk}(y) \xi_j \xi_k }$ is obtained from the Riemannian metric of $S^d$ in the coordinate system, and $\phi$ solves the eikonal equation $| (\nabla_x \phi)(x,y,\xi) |_x = |\xi|_y$ such that $\phi(x,y,\xi) = 0$ for $(x - y) \cdot \xi = 0$. Similar oscillatory integrals \emph{can} be obtained for $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ simply by the fact that they are obtained by repeated compositions of the propogators with $|t| < 1/2$, and qualitative understanding of their behavior can be understand from the general theory of \emph{Fourier integral operators}, but obtaining quantitative control on $e^{2 \pi i t P}$ for large $t$ becomes difficult.

%There is an analogue of convolution on spheres, and with any zonal multiplier there is a 'zonal convolution kernel'. However, this kernel is difficult to relate to the symbol of the multiplier. More importantly, the convolution kernel \emph{does not behave well under dilation symmetries of the symbol}, which makes it difficult to relate different scales of the problem together.

\subsection{Combining Dyadic Pieces With Atomic Decompositions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Next, we consider a decomposition $f = \sum f_k$, where the Fourier transform of $f_k$ is supported on $|\xi| \sim 2^k$, then we can write $Tf = \sum T_k f_k$. Bounds on $T_k$ have been controlled by the previous argument, and we are now left with the job of `recombining scales'. To obtain this bound, we consider a decomposition of each of the functions $f_k$ into `$L^\infty$ atoms'. Morally speaking, we are able to write $f_k = \sum A_{k,\theta}$, where $\theta$ runs over a family of dyadic boxes, each with side length exceeding $2^{-k}$, which morally we should think of as disjoint, and where $A_{k,\theta}$ is a 'molecule', which decomposes as $A_{k,\theta} = \sum a_{k,\theta,j}$, where $a_{k,\theta,j}$ is an `$L^\infty$ atom' on $\theta$, in the sense that $\| a_{k,j,\theta} \|_{L^\infty(\RR^d)} \lesssim |\theta|^{-1/p} \| a_{k,j,\theta} \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ and satisfy a square function estimate,
	%
%	\[ \left( \sum\nolimits_j \bigg\| \Big( \sum\nolimits_{k,\theta} |a_{k,j,\theta}|^2 \Big)^{\frac{1}{2}} \bigg\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^p \right)^{1/p} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}. \]
	%
	which reduces proving the bound $\| Tf \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ to proving a bound of the form
	%
	\[ \left\| \sum u_{k,j,\theta} \right\| \lesssim \left( \sum\nolimits_j \Big\| \Big( \sum\nolimits_{k,\theta} |a_{k,j,\theta}|^2 \Big)^{1/2} \Big\|_{L^p(\RR^d)}^p \right)^{1/p}, \]
	%
	where $u_{k,j,\theta} = T_k a_{k,j,\theta}$. Unlike the previous argument, we thus have to deal with the interaction between different frequency scales, but here we do have an additional square root cancellation to help obtain the bound.
\end{itemize}

The argument I obtained also follows this pattern, but we must introduce several new techniques when adapting the method the method to the study of spherical harmonics.

	The uniformity in $k$ actually follows immediately if we can prove the bound for $k = 0$ because of the dilation symmetry on $\RR^d$, and the fact that we have uniform control over the functions $\{ a_k \}$. In the analysis of the Fourier multiplier $T_0$, the support of the symbol implies 

The bound is then obtained by a geometric argument involving incidences of annuli. Once this is obtained, a square function bound implies control over $\sum T_k$.

First off, their assumptions are about uniform control over dyadic pieces of the symbol $a$. More precisely, if $a$ is dyadically decomposed as a sum $a(\rho) = \sum_{k \in \ZZ} a_k( \rho / 2^k)$, where $a_k$ has support on $[1,2]$, then the necessary and sufficient condition for boundedness is that the quantities $C_p(a_k)$ are uniformly bounded in $k$, where
%



First, a general symbol $a$ is dyadically decomposed as a sum $a(\rho) = \sum_{k \in \ZZ} b_k( \rho / 2^k)$, where each of the functions $b_k$ is supported on the interval $[1,2]$. If we set $a_k(\rho) = a_k( 2^k \rho)$, then $T_a = \sum T_{a_k}$.n

The proofs begin by establishing bounds of the form $\| T_{a_k} f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$, uniformly in $k$. By applying a dilation symmetry, it suffices without loss of generality to look at $a_0$.




Now how 


Suppose $a: [0,\infty) \to \CC$ is compactly supported on the interval $[1/2,2]$. Then the radial function $k(x) = \int a(|\xi|) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}\; d\xi$ is the a convolution kernel for the radial multiplier operator $T_a$, i.e. $T_a f = k * f$ for all inputs $f$. The bounds on radial multipliers obtained in BLAH are then of the form $\| T_a f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| k \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$. Dilation symmetry then immediately implies BLAH DYADIC RESULT, and then some methods of atomic decompositions and Littlewood Paley theory can be combined to obtain a tight result. On a sphere, we \emph{can} define the zonal convolution kernel $k$ corresponding to a zonal multiplier $Z_a$, such that
%
\[ (Z_a f)(x) = \int_{S^d} k( y \cdot x ) f(y)\; dy. \]
%
If $a$ is supported on $[1/2,2]$, then weighted $L^p$ bounds on $k$ can be used to imply bounds on $Z_a$, but these bounds will not scale, and it is difficult to determine how the bounds scale under dilations since there is no relation between the zonal convolution kernel $k$ corresponding to $a$, and the convolution kernel corresponding to the dilations of $a$.

A fix is obtained by writing $Z_a f$ using the \emph{cosine transform} of $a$, i.e. in terms of
%
\[ \widehat{a}(t) = \int_0^\infty a(\rho) e^{2 \pi i \rho t}\; d\rho. \]
%
The cosine transform \emph{does} scale under dilations, and functional calculus and the Fourier inversion formula allows us to write $Z_a$ in terms of $\widehat{a}$, i.e. by setting
%
\begin{equation} \label{InversionFormula}
	Z_a f = a(P) f = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \widehat{a}(t) e^{2 \pi i t P}\; dt,
\end{equation}
%
where $P = \sqrt{ \alpha^2 - \Delta }$, and $e^{2 \pi i t P} f = e^{2 \pi i t k} f$ for a spherical harmonic $f$ of degree $k$. The operators $u(t) = e^{2 \pi i t P} f$ give solutions to the half-wave equation $\partial_t u = P u$. We can understand the geometric behaviour of the half-wave equation by using the theory of \emph{Fourier integral operators}.

. Indeed, if $f$ is a spherical harmonic of degree $k$, then $Z_a f = a(k) f$ and by the Fourier inversion formula $\int \widehat{a}(t) e^{2 \pi i t P} f\; dt = \int \widehat{a}(t) e^{2 \pi i t k} f\; dt = a(k) f(t)$. For any function $f$, the functions $u(t) = e^{2 \pi i t P} f$ give a solution to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 u(t) = P u(t)$ with $u(0) = f$ and $\partial_t u(0) = 0$.


The bounds on radial multipliers obtained in BLAH depend on bounds on the convolution kernel corresponding to the multiplier. 


The main goal of my research project on multipliers is to understand


 deconstructive interference between a family of planar waves, or spherical harmonics of different degrees. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a Fourier multiplier operator to be bounded on $L^1(\RR^d)$ or $L^\infty(\RR^d)$ were quickly realized.

%Understanding the boundedness of Fourier multiplier operators in an $L^p$ norm for $p \neq 2$ underpins any subtle understanding of the Fourier transform. Plane waves oscillating in different directions and with different frequencies are orthogonal to one another, and thus do not interact with one another significantly in terms of the $L^2$ norm, as justified by Bessel's inequality. But plane waves can interact with one another in the $L^p$ norm for $p \neq 2$, and so understanding $L^p$ bounds for Fourier multipliers indicate when this interaction is significant or insignificant. Similarily, spherical harmonics of different degrees on $S^d$ are orthogonal to one another, but studying the $L^p$ bounds of multipliers of the Laplacian on the sphere is crucial to understand when the interactions of different spherical harmonics are significant or not.

%The general study of the $L^p$ boundedness of general Fourier multipliers began in the 1960s, brought on by the spur of applications the Calderon-Zygmund school and their contemporaries brought to the theory. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a Fourier multiplier to be bounded on $L^2(\RR^d)$ follow by simple orthogonality, and conditions to be bounded on $L^1(\RR^d)$ and $L^\infty(\RR^d)$ also follow simply, because such spaces do not tend to allow much capacity for subtle cancellation. But the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness in $L^p(\RR^d)$ for any other exponent proved impenetrable. Surprisingly, in the past decade necessary and sufficient conditions for $L^p$ boundedness have occured for \emph{radial} Fourier multipliers.

%Orthogonality immediately implies that a Fourier multiplier $T$ is bounded on $L^2(\RR^d)$ if and only if it's symbol $m$ lies in $L^\infty(\RR^d)$. Similarily, since spherical harmonics of different degrees are orthogonal to one another, a multiplier for spherical harmonic expansions is bounded on $L^2(S^d)$ if and only if $m \in L^\infty(\NN)$. The boundedness of such multipliers for $p \neq 2$ is a more subtle property, but underpins any deep understanding of the Fourier transform or the understanding of the interactions. Indeed, studying the boundedness of multipliers seems to be one of the few tractable ways of quantifying deconstructive interference between a family of planar waves, or spherical harmonics of different degrees. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a Fourier multiplier operator to be bounded on $L^1(\RR^d)$ or $L^\infty(\RR^d)$ were quickly realized.
%Spherical harmonics of different degrees are orthogonal to one another, and this immediately implies $T$ is bounded on $L^2(S^d)$ if and only if $m \in L^\infty(\NN)$. But characterizations of $L^p$ boundedness for all $p \neq 2$ remain unknown.


% It was quickly realized that a Fourier multiplier operator is bounded on $L^1(\RR^d)$ or $L^\infty(\RR^d)$ if and only if the Fourier transform of the symbol $m$ lies in $L^1(\RR^d)$.
% Indeed, many interesting problems about the boundedness of \emph{specific} Fourier multipliers, such as the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, remain largely unsolved today.

%It thus came as a recent surprise when necessary and sufficient conditions were found for bounding \emph{radial} Fourier multipliers (multipliers with a radial symbol) on $L^p(\RR^d)$. First came the result of \cite{GarrigosSeeger}, who found a necessary and sufficient condition in the range $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/2d$ for bounds of the form $\| Tf \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ to hold uniformly over \emph{radial functions} $f$.
%If $T$ has symbol $m(|\xi|)$, then the condition says that $T$ is bounded if and only if the Fourier transforms of the functions $m_k(\xi) = m(2^k \xi) \chi(|\xi|)$ are uniformly bounded in $L^p(\RR^d)$, where $\chi \in C_c^\infty(0,\infty)$ and $\sum_{k \in \ZZ} \chi(2^k \xi) = 1$.
%An optimist might think this same condition causes the bound to hold uniformly over \emph{all functions} $f$ in the range above, a statement we call the \emph{radial multiplier conjecture}. We now know, by the results of \cite{HeoNazarovSeeger} and \cite{Cladek}, that the radial multiplier conjecture holds when $d > 4$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/(d-1)$, when $d = 4$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 11/36$, and when $d = 3$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 11/26$. But the radial multiplier conjecture is not completely resolved for any $d$, and no bounds are known at all when $d = 2$.

%My main research project considers the study of the relation between the $L^p$ boundedness of two types of multipliers:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \emph{Fourier multipliers} are those operators $T$ on $\RR^d$ for which we can associate a function $m: \RR^d \to \CC$, known as the \emph{symbol} of $T$, such that for any function $f$, the Fourier transform of $Tf$ obeys the relation $\widehat{Tf} = m \widehat{f}$. Heuristically, this means that $T e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x} = m(\xi) e^{2 \pi i \xi \cdot x}$ for each $\xi \in \RR^d$.
%\end{itemize}

%  Every translation invariant operator on $\RR^d$ is a Fourier multiplier operator, and every rotation invariant operator on $S^d$ is a multiplier of the spherical harmonic expansion on $S^d$.

Such operators initially arose from the study of the classical partial differential equations in physics, and continue to have applications in areas as diverse as partial differential equations, mathematical physics, number theory, and ergodic theory. Every translation invariant operator on $\RR^d$ is a Fourier multiplier operator, and every rotation invariant operator on $S^d$ is a multiplier of the spherical harmonic expansion on $S^d$.

any such operator $T$, we can associate a function $m: \RR^n \to \CC$, known as the \emph{symbol} of $T$, such that for any function $f$, the Fourier transform of $Tf$ obeys the relation $\widehat{Tf} = m \widehat{f}$; thus translation invariant operators are also called \emph{Fourier multiplier operators}.

Understanding the boundedness of Fourier multiplier operators in an $L^p$ norm for $p \neq 2$ underpins any subtle understanding of the Fourier transform. Plane waves oscillating in different directions and with different frequencies are orthogonal to one another, and thus do not interact with one another significantly in terms of the $L^2$ norm, as justified by Bessel's inequality. But plane waves can interact with one another in the $L^p$ norm for $p \neq 2$, and so understanding $L^p$ bounds for Fourier multipliers indicate when this interaction is significant or insignificant. Similarily, spherical harmonics of different degrees on $S^d$ are orthogonal to one another, but studying the $L^p$ bounds of multipliers of the Laplacian on the sphere is crucial to understand when the interactions of different spherical harmonics are significant or not.

The general study of the characterizations of $L^p$ boundedness for the Fourier multipliers was initiated in the 1960s. Mathematicians quickly found simple necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure Fourier multipliers are bounded on $L^1(\RR^d)$, $L^2(\RR^d)$, and $L^\infty(\RR^d)$. But the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness in $L^p(\RR^d)$ for any other exponent proved impenetrable. Indeed, many interesting problems about the boundedness of \emph{specific} Fourier multipliers, such as the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, remain largely unsolved today.

Thus it came as a surprise in the past decade when results emerged proving necessary and sufficient conditions for \emph{radial} Fourier multipliers to be bounded on $L^p(\RR^d)$. First came the result of BLAH, which gave a necessary and sufficient criteria for bounds of the form $\| Tf \|_{L^p(\RR^d)} \lesssim \| f \|_{L^p(\RR^d)}$ to hold uniformly over \emph{radial functions} $f$, for $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/2d$. An optimist might think this same condition causes the bound to hold uniformly over \emph{all functions} $f$ in the range above, a statement we call the \emph{radial multiplier conjecture}. We now know, by the results of BLAH and BLAH, that the radial multiplier conjecture holds when $d > 4$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 1/(d-1)$, when $d = 4$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 11/36$, and when $d = 3$ and $|1/p - 1/2| > 11/26$. But the radial multiplier conjecture has not yet been completely solved in any dimension $d$, and no bounds are known at all when $d = 2$.

The natural analogue of the study of radial multipliers on $\RR^d$ is the study of multipliers of a Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold. The natural analogue of the study of quasiradial multipliers on $\RR^d$ is the study of multipliers of an operator associated with a \emph{Finsler geometry} on the manifold.
