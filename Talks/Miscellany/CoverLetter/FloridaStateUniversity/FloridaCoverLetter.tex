\begin{newlfm}

I am currently a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and expect to graduate in the coming spring. My Research Interests lie primarily in harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and probability theory, though I am also beginning to explore problems related to nonlinear wave equations. My thesis problem focuses on studying spectral multipliers on compact manifolds using methods of Fourier integral operators, which I am working on under the supervision of Professor Andreas Seeger. During my PhD, I also developed methods of probability to analyze the Fourier analytic properties of random fractal sets avoiding configurations.

At Florida State University, I am primarily interested in working with Professor Alexander Reznikov, who shares my interests in the interactions of harmonic analysis and probability theory with geometric measure theory. More details about these projects can be found in my Research Statement.

Thank you for your consideration,\\\\
Jacob Denson
