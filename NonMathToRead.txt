=== Ethics ===
==============

- Sidgwick.
	The Methods of Ethics

	Clearest and most accessible book on classical Utilitarianism.
- Parfit.
	Reasons and Persons

	Argues that it is often rational to act against our own best interests, and that most of us have self-defeating worldviews.

		(From an Amazon Review) Reasons and Persons is divided into four sections. The first two systematically show that ethical egoism and common-sense intuitions about morality are incoherent and that consequentialism solves all the problems these two bases of morality contain. The third section is on personal identity and shows that the two classic western conceptions of identity have fatal flaws. He instead advocates for a reductionist picture of personal identity as a series of relationships to other people and things that wither and change over time. He then discusses the ethical implications of the view. The fourth section is maybe my favorite single section of any philosophy book I've read. It discusses four serious problems in population ethics -- The Nonidentity Problem, the Repugnant Conclusion, the Absurd Conclusion, and the Mere Addition Paradox -- that he thinks any good moral theory must solve. The only problem is that none of the traditional conceptions, most alarmingly deontology and consequentialism, are up to the task. Deontology can't explain the Nonidentity Problem, and Utilitarianism fails to avoid the Mere Addition Paradox. Therefore, no moral theory as of yet is perfectly satisfying. This fourth book has spawned its own industry in professional ethics, and mountains of papers can been written attempting to solve these problems. Thus far, no Deontological solutions to the Nonidentity Problem nor Consequentialist solutions to the Mere Addition Paradox have satisfied people.
