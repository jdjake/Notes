# Math Book Recommendations

Here I've recorded some math books that I found the most useful for learning a particular topic, inspired by the "Chicago Undergraduate Mathematics Bibliography" (https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm), which I found very useful during my undergraduate years:

An ! before the title of a book is used to indicate a book I have only read a small portion of, but which I found useful enough to write down in case I ever need to read further into a particular field.


## Fundamentals

### Linear Algebra

- Charles Curtis, Linear Algebra: An Introductory Approach

	The First Linear Algebra Book I read. Does the job of teaching the basic ideas, without too much flair or extras.

- Paul Halmos, Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces

	Utilizes the modern terminology and techniques of functional analysis on infinite dimensional vector spaces to the finite dimensional. Suprisingly, this modern approach makes the material very readable.

- Stephen Friedberg / Arnold Insel / Lawrence Spence, Linear Algebra

	Pretty bog standard linear algebra book. Gets through all the potential topics you need.

- Peter Lax, Linear Algebra and its Applications

	An advanced book on finite dimensional linear algebra and matrix theory. Most people skip these parts of linear algebra, but there are very important uses for this theory! Not all linear algebra is functional analysis in disguise. Read this for concreteness!

- ! Denis Serre, Matrices
		
- ! Rajendra Bhatia, Positive Definite Matrices

### Discrete Mathematics

- Ronald Graham / Donald Knuth / Oren Patashnik, Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computing Science

	A problems book designed so that computing science students can read Donald Knuth's monolithic "The Art of Computer Programming" series. However, it really is a good introduction to the basic ideas of discrete mathematics, solving recurrences, basic number theory, generating functions, discrete probablity theory, and asymptotics. Very useful, and you'll likely learn techniques you didn't know if you read it, even if you think you already know all the discrete mathematics you will need.

- John Michael Steele, The Cauchy Schwartz Master Class

- ! Gowers, Techniques in Combinatorics

###	Calculus & Introductory Analysis

- Walter Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis

	Very terse text in basic analysis.

- Michael Spivak, Calculus

	Less terse text in basic analysis.

- Thomas Korner, A Companion to Analysis

	Great supplement to a basic analysis course. Explains 'why' basic analysis isn't so intuitive as you might believe.

- Hermann Schey, Div, Grad, Curl, and all that

	Great introduction to classical vector calculus.
	
- Michael Spivak, Calculus on Manifolds

	Covers basic multivariate calculus, and elementary differential forms / integration on manifolds.

- Vladimir Arnold, Ordinary Differential Equations

	A much more 'practical' differential equations book. Talks about the actual geometrical theory behind differential equations, and an introduction to the more 'chaotic aspects' relating differential equations to dynamical systems. Choose this if you want a differential equations course that is actually interesting! The second edition republishing by Springer includes many real-word examples of differential equation (logistic equation, Lotka-Volterra, etc) which add variety to the exposition

## Advanced Topics

### Abstract Algebra

- Kostrikin / Shafarevich, Algebra I: Basic Notions

	Introduces the general fields of abstract algebra (Groups, rings, modules, etc) as a natural extension of certain practical problems that arise in fields of mathematics. I only read this book after I already knew about all these structures, but the book really made them 'fit' in my mind with respect to the general field of mathematics. I am very interested in how successful an 'algebra' course would be if it introduced the field of abstract algebra as a consolidated whole like this book tries to accomplish.

- Serge Lang, Algebra

	Terse but thorough. I suggest reading it along with G. Bergman's companion to the book.

- Michael Artin, Algebra

	Tries to use more 'matrix / linear algebra' knowledge to build up a knowledge of basic algebra.

- Dummett / Foote, Algebra

- ! Eisenbud, Commutative Algebra

- ! Gathman, Commutative Algebra

- ! Clark, Commutative Algebra

- ! Maclane, Category Theory

### Algebraic Topology

- Allen Hatcher, Algebraic Topology

- ! John Stillwell, Classical Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory

	Gives geometry inspiration for the basic concepts of algebraic topology: fundamental groups and homology theory.

### Measure Theory

- Walter Rudin, Real and Complex analysis

	One of the best and most concise introductions to measure theory I've read. The first chapter essentially includes all the big theorems of measure theory you'll need, and the next few chapters include the other little important things that are useful (product measures, radon nikodym derivates, etc). Also includes a strange second part on complex analysis that I haven't got round to reading, but apparently proceeds by an incredible strange approach.

- Terrence Tao, An Introduction to Measure Theory

	Very good for building intuition.

- Elias Stein / Rami Shakarchi, Princeton Lectures in Analysis (Vol 3: Measure Theory, Integration and Hilbert Spaces)

- Paul Halmos, Measure Theory

###	Functional Analysis

- Elias Stein / Rami Shakarchi, Princeton Lectures in Analysis (Vol 4: Functional Analysis)

- ! Paul Halmos, A Hilbert Space Problem Book

- John Conway, A Course in Functional Analysis

- Peter Lax, Functional Analysis

	Really good for applications of functional analysis, giving motivations for the study of functional analysis rather than just the abstract theory.

- Francois Treves, Topological Vector Spaces, Distributions, and Kernels

- Walter Rudin, Functional Analysis

- ! Fabian, Habala, Hajek, Montesinos, Zivler, Banach Space Theory

	Incredibly comprehensive book on the advanced areas of Banach space

	(It gets more physicsy after this, but this is still interesting, especially since it motivated quite a bit of modern differential geometry to begin with)

	Despite it's name, this lectures series is an introduction to the basic ideas of differentiable manifolds, with the goal of introducing them to theoretical physicists. Based on your experience, you can probably skip some of these lectures, but they proceed at a very gradual pace and introduce all the essentials to manifold theory. While I was studying the basic properties of differential geometry, they made a nice complement to Volume 1 of Spivaks' differential geometry introduction, and Lees introduction to smooth manifolds.

- John Lee, Introduction to Smooth Manifolds

	I found this book a little bit more concise than Spivaks book, which helped make some concepts more readable. But I still think both should be read for a true understanding of differential geometry.

- ! Tu, Differential Geometry: Connections, Curvature, and Characteristic Classes

- ! Needham, Visual Differential Geometry and Forms, A Mathematical Drama in Five Acts

- ! Serge Lang, Fundamentals of Differential Geometry

	In true, abstract Serge Lang style, the book introduces the usual theory of differentiable manifolds as a theory of spaces that look locally like infinite dimensional Banach spaces. If you like Serge Lang books, you'll like this one.

	Good intro to someone who hasn't had any 'real' mathematical logic yet.

- Mendelson, Introduction to Mathematical Logic

- ! Jech, Set Theory

- ! Dirk Van Dalen, Logic and Structure

### Theoretical Computing Science

- Michael Sipser, Introduction to the Theory of Computation

	The standard introduction to models of computation. Starts off with the basic forms of computation, including introductions to pushdown automata and grammars, but quickly moves onto computability in Turing machines. An interesting feature of this book is that each big proof is preceded by a 'proof idea' section, which explains the idea behind the more technical parts of the proof you're about to read. This is really useful, and this technique should be used in more basic introductions to mathematical subjects. The only weakness of this book is that it doesn't include the parts of computation theory that connect to mathematical logic, which I have yet to find a good resource for yet.

- ! Boaz Barak, Introduction to Theoretical Computing Science

- ! Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak, Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach

	Yes. There is a whole diverse theory of computational complexity which goes beyond 'Does P = NP'. This is THE book for this topic, and includes a range of different advanced subjects going beyond the basic complexity classes encountered in an introductory course in a theory of computation. I haven't had a chance to read it throughly, but the special topics I have read into (probabilistically checkable proofs and the PCP theorem) were well put together.

### Abstract Harmonic Analysus

- Gerald B. Folland, A Course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis

- Walter Rudin, Fourier Analysis on Groups

	An introduction to only the abelian aspects of abstract harmonic analysis. A good complement to Follands book, which focuses on aspects of the theory important to the noncommutative theory.

- !Edwin Hewitt, Kenneth Ross, Abstract Harmonic Analysis (Vol 1-2)

	Incredibly comprehensive, but so slow going I can't recommend it for a first introduction.

###	Modular Forms

- ! Jan Hendrik Bruiner / Gerad van der Geer / Gunter Harder / Don Zagier, The 1-2-3 of Modular Forms

	This was the book that really attracted me to the theory of modular forms and their applications. Unlike other books, which focus specifically on the theory without introducing applications, this book introduces the applications while introducing the theory, which makes the path to understanding modular forms much more visceral.

- ! Don Zagier Lectures in Modular Forms

	Lecture 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKt5L0ggZ3o

	Lecture 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVje_MN8SUE

	Lecture 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFaX8eNn64A

	Lecture 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpanciocK4Y

	Lecture 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwWOH9ty9b0

	Really good introduction to Modular forms, from the view of theoretical physics (but still a useful introduction for mathematicians!).

- Fred Diamond / Jerry Shurman, A First Course in Modular Forms

	This book introduces the Riemann surface theory which connects to Modular forms, which helped me understand some of the technical aspects of the theory, and its generalizations to the theory of automorphic forms. Maybe if you read a better resource on general Riemann surfaces this is unneccessary, and I might find this book not so useful once I know Rieman surface theory, but for now it's still very useful.
