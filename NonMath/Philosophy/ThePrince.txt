Niccolo Machiavelli:
	- 1469: Born in Florence, 1469, under the rule of Lorenzo de' Medici, a son of a reputable lawyer, and a member of the old Florentine nobility.
	- 1494: The Medici were expelled from Florence, the same year he started serving the republic in public office.
	- 1498: Appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and Peace.
	- 1499: Sent as envoy to Catherine Sforza, where he learned that "it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses".
	- 1500: Sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII to continue war against Pisa. This was the king whose five errors in statecraft, summarized in The Prince, caused him to be exiled.
	- 1503: Pope Pius III died, and Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch the election of the successor. Cesare Borgia was cheated into allowing the College to elect Julius II, who most feared the duke, and did not rest until he had destroyed Cesare. A majority of Nachiavelli's public life was occupied with dealing with events resulting from the ambitions of the Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia. Machiavelli constantly cites the actions of the duke as examples of actions usurpers take to maintain power, but also cited as a man who rises on the fortunes of others, and falls with them, prepared for all eventualities but the one that happens.
	- 1508: The League of Cambrai, made between France, Germany, Spain, and the Pope, is formed with the goal of defeating the Venetian republic. 
	- Pope Julius II fell out with France, which caused Florence difficulty since the republic was dictated by friendship with France.
	- 1511: Julius II formed the Holy League with Switzerland against France, driving them out of Italy. As a result, Florence has to return the Medici to power.
	- 1512: Medici returned to power. Machiavelli hoped he would remain in office under the Medici, but he was imprisoned and tortured instead. The new pope, Leo X, got him released, and he was allowed to retire in San Casciano, just outside of Florence. 

	- During his youth, Lorezo de' Medici reules Florence. In 1494, Machiavelli entered public service, the same year Medici met his downfall in Florence, with a republic lasting until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office, and he started gaining more influence as a writer. He died in 1527, weeks after the Medici were again expelled from Florence, without having regained his office.
