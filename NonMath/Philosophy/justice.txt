"Outrage at price-gougers is more than mindless anger. It gestures at a moral argument worth taking seriously. Outrage is the special kind of anger you feel when you believe that people are getting things they don't deserve. Outrage of this king is anger at injustice."

"To acknowledge the moral force of the virtue argument is not to insist that it must always prevail over competing considerations. You might conclude, in some instances, that a hurricane-stricken community should make a devil's bargain -- allow price gouging in hopes of attracting an army of roofers and contractors from far and wide, even at the moral cost of sanctioning greed. Repair the roofs now, and the social fabric later."

"The same culture that demands tough-mindedness also encourages skepticism towards the suggestion that the violence of war can hurt the healthiest of. As long as our military culture bears at least a quiet contempt for the psychological wounds of war, it is unlikely those veterans will ever see a purple heart."

This is America. We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achieving success. And we certainly believe success should be rewarded. But what gets people upset -- and rightfully so -- are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when those rewards are subsidized by the US taxpayer.

One of the most bizarre statements about bailout ethics came from Senator Charles Grassley, a fiscal conservative form the heartland. At the height of the bonus furor, Grassley said in an Iowa radio interview that what bothered him most was the refusal of the corporate executives to take any blame for their failures. He would ``feel a bit better towards them if they would follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, `I'm sorry', and then either do one of two things -- resign or go commit suicide.''

If moral reflection is dialectical -- if it moves back and forth between the judgements we make in concrete situations and the principles that inform those judgements -- it needs opinions and convictions, however partial and untutored, as grounds and grist. A philosophy untouched by the shadows on the wall can only yield a sterile utopia.





Moral reflection arises as a result of asking hard moral questions. We start with a gut feeling. Then we try and determine the premise behind that gut feeling, which might lead to confusing consequences. Feeling the force of that confusion is the impulse of philosophy, a dialectic between judgement and principle.

Natural question, if we are trying to find principles behind our gut judgements, how can this process lead to moral truth / justice. The process is not purely internal because of the dialectic (even if the dialectic is between an imagined opposite rather than an actual person). Our goal is to try and rise above prejudice and routine, but not to the level of pure theoretics. We need engagements with everyday issues to articulate and justify moral convictions.


Calicles told So - Philosophy distances up from conventions, from estabislhed assumptions, and from settled beliefs.

Response, Skepticism:
	- Great philosophers couldn't resolve these questions, so who are we to think that we can resolve these questions.
	- These questions are unavoidable. We live an answer to these questions every day.

Justice:
	- How should individuals treat each other.
	- What should the law be.
	- How should we organize society.
	- How should we distribute the things we prize as a society, and give people what they deserve.

Theories of Justice
	- Maximizing welfare: We should distribute things such as to maximize the welfare of people. This leads to utilitarianism.
	- Rights Theory: Justice means respecting universal human rights and freedoms.
		- Two rival camps
			- Laissez-Faire libertarians, justice means upholding the voluntary choices made by consenting adults.
			- Fairness: Unfettered markets are neither just nor free.
	- Virtues Theory: Societal decisions are about cultivating attitudes and character qualities that good societies depend on.
		- Modern groups such as abolitionists and civil rights activists have drawn from virtue theories of justice.

		- Liberal society theoretically doesn't like this theory so much, b/c it goes against the ideas of tolerance and freedom. Who are you to judge what is right or wrong in a diverse society? Because of this, governments should be neutral on issues of virtue.

		- Issue divides classical justice philosophers from modern philosophers:
			- Aristotle: Justice means giving people what they deserve, which means we have to decide what actions should be rewarded / punished. Thus a just constitution is premised on virtues. Law cannot be neutral on what is good.

			- Modern political philosophers: A just society respects each individual's choice on what their conception of the good life is.



Examples:

Case for unfettered markets:
	- Markets lead to better welfare of people of society (people get what they value most).
	- Markets respect individual freedom.
Case against:
	- Welfare of society is not the outcome of unfettered markets when applied to justify exorbitant prices in hard times. One must evaluate the burden placed on those who cannot afford these prices in hard times (being forced to pay exorbitant prices might put people in harm's way). One must account for the pain of those who will not be able to afford these basic necessities.
	- The free market is not truly free. People need to pay for safe lodging. The gas you need to pay for in order to drive your family out of harm's way is not a free choice. So paying for these services is not a free, voluntary exchange.
	- Virtue Argument: Greed is a vice, more than just personally, but a societal vice since it goes against civic virtue. In times of trouble, people should look out for one another. Thus excessive greed is something that a good society should discourage. By punishing greedy behaviour / restraining it's expression, society affirms the civic virtue to sacrifice for the common good.

Purple Heart should be reserved for soldiers with physical injuries.
	- Pentagon argument: Mental injuries are not on purpose, and cannot be diagnosed as objectively.
		- First doesn't hold ground b/c people get purple hearts for eardrum damage from explosions, which aren't the purpose of the explosions in the first place.

	- Certainly meant to reward a virtue, but what are the virtues?
		- Honors sacrifice, not bravery, since no heroic act is required to get the purple heart.

	- Arguments for:
		- Many people in the military view mental disorders as a kind of weakness, which isn't a virtue of the military.

Bailouts for banks:
	- No one argued that banks `deserved' the bailouts, but it was a necessary fact to prevent the financial system from collapsing.

	- Some executives in banks recieved bonuses that same year. There was moral outrage. These executives had done nothing to `deserve' those bonuses. Two arguments for this:
		- Giving out bonuses rewards greed and recklessness.
			- This argument runs into problems, since it doesn't seem to distinguish problems with giving out bonuses during good times to giving out bonuses during bad times. Since the virtue of stock market traders seems unlikely to change on the winds of the economy, it thus seems wrong to give out bonuses at any time of the year.
				- One difference is that tax payer money is being funneled out in the former case, vs. company earnings in the latter.
		- Another argument: Giving out bonuses rewards failure.
			- The idea that people deserve the rewards that come from success is part of the American Dream.
			- CEOs argued that they had no control over the crisis. It was `a financial Tsunami' beyond control.
				- Young traders: "There's no sympathy for us. But it's not as if we weren't working hard."
				- But if this is the case, then how can CEOs justify that they are also responsible for the successes of earlier years?

			- If money earned correlates to hardwork, why are CEOs paid 344 times the pay of the average worker, vs. in 1980, where CEOs are paid 42 times what their workers did. Why do US CEOs make 12 times the wage of Japanese CEOs?

Trolley Problem:
	- 5 people ahead, will surely die unless you divert the trolley to another truck where a single worker is fixing some tracks.
		- Utilitarian argument: Turn, since less people will die as a result.

	- What if instead of diverting the tracks, you could push a man off the bridge, whose body would stop the trolley from killing five people?
		- Utilitarian argument still stands. Maybe you're just squeamish, and should morally overcome this because it's the correct thing to do.

		- Pushing the man uses his body against his will.
			- But the same could be argued of the worker, at least assuming that sacrificing his life is not part of their job description.

- US soldiers on secret reconnaissance mission in Afghanistan. Two Afghan farmers and a boy came upon them. Letting them free would mean it would be highly likely for them to be killed by the Taliban. After making a vote, they decided to let them go, and an hour and a half later, they were surrounded by 80-100 Taliban fighters. Three of the four soldiers were killed, with one severely injured, having to crawl seven miles to the nearest US allied village.
	- Uncertainty made the decision hard. But if they were sure these three would tell the Taliban, would that justify killing them? What if the farmers only gave out that information because they were interrogated?
		- Slightly more sympathetic than pushing the man off the bridge since they are in moral error. If the man on the bridge was responsible for the trolley error, would it become less morally objectionable to push him off the bridge.
