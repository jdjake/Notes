Descartes

Why Study Descartes? Foundation for questions of modern age





- Major influence on rationalist philosophy (Descartes, Leibnitz, and Spinoza being main examples). The very reductive categorization being that the mind reveals the true nature of the world around us. This contrasts empiricism, which has the main belief that experience is the sole guide to true knowledge.

- One of the first works fo philosphy in the period of modernity, an 'age of amnesia' where philosophers attempted to construct knowledge from scratch, rather than relying on previous works of authority.

- Descartes was born in 1596. He was educated by Jesuits from approximately 1607 to approximately 1614, and he was loyal to the catholic church for his entire life. He graduated from college in 1614. In 1618, he enlisted as a mercenary under the command of Maurice of Nassau in Holland, soon to be Prince of Orange. In 1619, he left the service of Maurice of Nassau and joined the service of Duke Maximilian of Bavaria until he left in 1620. He is generally believed to be an engineering mercenary rather than a more swashbuckling mercenary. It was during his time in the army during the 30 years war (on the nights of the 10th and 11th of November, 1619) that Descartes shut himself in a room with a fireplace to escape the cold. Here he had three dreams, and believed a divine spirit had revealed a new philosophy to him, on analytic geometry, philosophy, and metaphysics. In 1621, Descartes became tired of being stationed in Bohemia, and left the army, returning to France. Between 1621 to 1628, he travelled across Europe, meeting various academics, seeing the sights, and performing a pilgrimage. After selling some of the property obtained as inheritance from his mother (who died when he was one) and maternal grandparents, in 1623 in invested in Bonds, which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life. He continued his thinking about philosophy, conversing with many philosophers and priests. In 1628, due to the rising religious intolerence in France (expelling the Jews in 1615, crushing out all Protestant strongholds in France, burning heretics), Descartes moved to Holland, which was his home until 1649, when he moved to Sweden on invitation of Queen Christina to teach her philosophy. He had to get up at 5am every morning to teach her philosophy, and didn't take to the climate, catching pneumonia and dying in 1650.




Main Points of View

	- The world isn't what we think it is, because our perceptions are separate from how the world actually is
	- Sciences uncovers the structure of reality. It isn't what we feel or sense
	- Don't use tradition. Throw out all which you aren't certain of, and use logic to determine knowledge.
	- Your senses decieve you some of the time, so you cannot trust them

	- Goes Too Far: Once you have a demon influencing all of your perceptions, why can it not just influence what you think as well (i.e. why must the cogito in cogito ergo sum true?).
	- Doesn't Go Far Enough:
