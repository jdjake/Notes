Plato (428BC-348BC, probably...)
	- Came from an aristocratic, well off family.
	- Had two brothers, Glaucon and Adeimantus, and a step father in politics.
	- It was natural given his class and connections to become a politician, but instead he became a 'philosophical politican'. In his 7th letter, he writes that the history he lived through made him believe that the politics of the cities existing during his time were beyond fixing.
		- Lived through the 30 tyrants who ruled Athens after the Spartans from 404-403 (his uncle Charmides and cousin Critias were 2 of these tyrants).
		- The government after the tyrants executed his friend Socrates, who he thought was the most just man in Athens (Socrates refused to bring a man to the tyrants for execution, despite risking the most extreme penalties for doing so).

	- Student of Socrates
		- Socrates' philosophy consisted of questioning peoples assumptions about virtues (justice, piety, courage, moderation, wisdom, friendship, etc), and assuming there was a definite property which captured these definitions.
		- Socrates used his dialectic method, the 'elenchus', continually poking holes in people's arguments until satisfactory knowledge has been obtained. This is not only to obtain knowledge, but Socrates thinks these method of questioning brings people happy and makes them more virtuous people.
		- Most of Socrates arguments we know of end unsatisfactorily, but he does come to the agreement that no one ever acts against what they know to be the best option, i.e. weakness of will does not exist (we know this from Protagoras' surviving writings).

	- After Socrated died, moved to Megara in with the philosopher Eucleides.
		- Eucleides was a follower of Parmenides, who believed that nothing can be discussed which is not, because if it really was not, it couldn't be discussed or talked about. A consequence is that (since two forms are 'not' one form) only one form exists.
		- This may have inspired Plato's views on Platonic forms.

	- When Plato was around 40 years old, he may have visited Italy and Sicily to visit Pythagorean philosophers, especially Archytas. Pythagoreans were obssessed with number and ratio (Archytas found the ratios defining harmonic, enharmonic, and chromatic scales)
		- May have influenced Plato's view of forms only being satisfactorily being defined in terms of numbers and ratios.

		- In Sicily, became friends with the current tyrant Dionysius I's brother in law, Dion. Dion became Plato's pupil, and convinced him that living a good life was better than leading a pleasurable and luxurious life that comes with being a ruler. There is some evidence that Dionysius expelled Plato and sold him into slavery, until rescued by a benevolent stranger.

	- Around 385BC, returned to Athens , bought land in the precinct of the hero Academus, and founded his famous school, the Academy, which lasted until 529AD. Plato spent most of the remainder of his life teaching in the academy. Most likely wrote 'The Republic' in the academy, in 380BC.
		- Notable Members of the Academy:
			- Eudoxus gave a geometrical description of the motion of the planets, and developed a theory of proportion including incommensurate magnitudes.
			- Theaetetus developed the geometry of solids.
			- Heraclidus Ponticus discovered the revolution of Venus and Mercury around the sun
			- Various cities, Arcadia, Pyrria, Cidus, and Stagira at least, invited academics to help them develop new political constitutions.

	- In 368BC, After Dionysius I died, Dion persuaded his son, Dionysius II, to ask for Plato to give advice on how to run Sicily. This didn't work out since Dionysius II did not want to learn philosophy or mathematics. Plato was allowed to return home in 366BC. He return in 362BC to fullfill a promise, and was kept there until released by ambassadors from Tarentum sent by his friend Archytas.

- Plato's aim in the republic
	- In the beginning, an argument given to Thrasymachus is given, that being 'just' is not in everyone's best interests, since what people think is 'just' is often influenced by the opinions of ruling powers, who act in their own interest.
		- A consequence is that Socratic dialogue cannot discover the truth of virtues, but only what people 'think' are the virtues.

	- Goal of Plato is to get around this, showing that justice is in everyone's best interests, because it is required in order to be truly happy.
		- Philosopher kings must study mathematics, and use it to define justice, courage, moderation, and other virtues, because it is less open to ideological influence (ironically, I guess they didn't have statistics back then).
		- People with different desires (appetitive desires for food, sex, drink, and money, spiritual desires for honor, victory and reputation, and rational desires for knowledge and truth) have different ideas of virtues. Plato thinks he can show that only the rational desires.
		- Plato believes the fundamental goal of education is to change people's desires, turning them from the pursuit of false desire to true happiness.
		- Thus if one educates rulers, they will want to be philosopher kings, whose goal is the pursuit of wisdom, and these people will have in their best interests to educate their citizens, which will lead them to be virtuous.
		- Thus there is a way to be just.
