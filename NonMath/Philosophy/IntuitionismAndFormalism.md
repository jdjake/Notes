# Intuitionism and Formalism
# By L. E. J. Brouwer



## Quotes:

Philosophy, if it cannot *answer* so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of *asking* questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.

All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctivel. Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.

Most philosophers, rightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than this -- that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attianable, concerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of ultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest function we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and certainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequecy of common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that philosophical problems involve.

The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings it neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.

When Swift invites us to consider the race of Struldbugs who never die, we are able to acquiesce in imagination. But a world where two and two make five seems quite on a different level. We feel that such a world, if there were one, would upset the whole fabric of our knowledge and reduce us to utter doubt.

We do not know who will be the inhabitants of London a hundred years hence; but we know that any two of them and any other two of them will make four of them.

The world of being is unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician, the builder of metaphysical systems, and all who love perfection more than life. The world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries, without any clear plan or arrangement, but it contains all thoughts and feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything that can do either good or harm, everything that makes any difference to the value of life and the world. According to our temperaments, we shall prefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. The one we do not prefer will probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and hardly worthy to be regarded as in any sense real. But the truth is that both have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real, and both are important to the metaphysician.

But for the fact of memory in this sense, we should not know there was a past at all, nor should we be able to understand the word 'past', any more than a blind man can understand the word "light". Thus there must be intuitive judgements of memory.

As it is, the test of coherence condemns the dreams, and confirms the waking life.

The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.

Apart from its utility in showing unsuspected possibilities, philosophy has a value—perhaps its chief value—through the greatness of the objects which it contemplates, and the freedom from narrow and personal aims resulting from this contemplation. The life of the instinctive man is shut up within the circle of his private interests: family and friends may be included, but the outer world is not regarded except as it may help or hinder what comes within the circle of instinctive wishes. In such a life there is something feverish and confined, in comparison with which the philosophic life is calm and free. The private world of instinctive interests is a small one, set in the midst of a great and powerful world which must, sooner or later, lay our private world in ruins. Unless we can so enlarge our interests as to include the whole outer world, we remain like a garrison in a beleagured fortress, knowing that the enemy prevents escape and that ultimate surrender is inevitable. In such a life there is no peace, but a constant strife between the insistence of desire and the powerlessness of will. In one way or another, if our life is to be great and free, we must escape this prison and this strife.

One way of escape is by philosophic contemplation. Philosophic contemplation does not, in its widest survey, divide the universe into two hostile camps—friends and foes, helpful and hostile, good and bad—it views the whole impartially. Philosophic contemplation, when it is unalloyed, does not aim at proving that the rest of the universe is akin to man. All acquisition of knowledge is an enlargement of the Self, but this enlargement is best attained when it is not directly sought. It is obtained when the desire for knowledge is alone operative, by a study which does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that character, but adapts the Self to the characters which it finds in its objects. This enlargement of Self is not obtained when, taking the Self as it is, we try to show that the world is so similar to this Self that knowledge of it is possible without any admission of what seems alien. The desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion and, like all self-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of Self which it desires, and of which the Self knows that it is capable. Self-assertion, in philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to its own ends; thus it makes the world of less account than Self, and the Self sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. In contemplation, on the contrary, we start from the not-Self, and through its greatness the boundaries of Self are enlarged; through the infinity of the universe the mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.

For this reason greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies which assimilate the universe to Man. Knowledge is a form of union of Self and not-Self; like all union, it is impaired by dominion, and therefore by any attempt to force the universe into conformity with what we find in ourselves. There is a widespread philosophical tendency towards the view which tells us that Man is the measure of all things, that truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals are properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created by the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us. This view, if our previous discussions were correct, is untrue; but in addition to being untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of all that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to Self. What it calls knowledge is not a union with the not-Self, but a set of prejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between us and the world beyond. The man who finds pleasure in such a theory of knowledge is like the man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear his word might not be law.

The true philosophic contemplation, on the contrary, finds its satisfaction in every enlargement of the not-Self, in everything that magnifies the objects contemplated, and thereby the subject contemplating. Everything, in contemplation, that is personal or private, everything that depends upon habit, self-interest, or desire, distorts the object, and hence impairs the union which the intellect seeks. By thus making a barrier between subject and object, such personal and private things become a prison to the intellect. The free intellect will see as God might see, without a here and now, without hopes and fears, without the trammels of customary beliefs and traditional prejudices, calmly, dispassionately, in the sole and exclusive desire of knowledge—knowledge as impersonal, as purely contemplative, as it is possible for man to attain. Hence also the free intellect will value more the abstract and universal knowledge into which the accidents of private history do not enter, than the knowledge brought by the senses, and dependent, as such knowledge must be, upon an exclusive and personal point of view and a body whose sense-organs distort as much as they reveal.

The mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of philosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom and impartiality in the world of action and emotion. It will view its purposes and desires as parts of the whole, with the absence of insistence that results from seeing them as infinitesimal fragments in a world of which all the rest is unaffected by any one man's deeds. The impartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth, is the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in emotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only to those who are judged useful or admirable. Thus contemplation enlarges not only the objects of our thoughts, but also the objects of our actions and our affections: it makes us citizens of the universe, not only of one walled city at war with all the rest. In this citizenship of the universe consists man's true freedom, and his liberation from the thraldom of narrow hopes and fears.








## Chapter Notes

*Science* is the systemic catologuing the laws of nature by which certain phenomena *cause* certain phenomena. The power that science leads to man is the ability to bring about certain primary phenomena, which may be difficult to achieve directly, by evoking other phenomena connected by science as a cause for this primary phenomena. Mankind can create order in the universe by isolating causal sequences of phenomena from other causes, as well as introducing other phenomena caused by it's own activity. Most important of this is the phenomena of *measuring* and *counting*.

Often natural laws connected to measurement can only be understood to hold up to a certain degree of approximation or error, and it is often our ability to measure and count objects to a greater degree of accuracy which induces new theories of science. The exceptions to thes rules have been the laws of arithmetic and geometry, and of rigid bodies and celestial mechanics, which have resisted most improvements in accurate measurements. Though for the latter this is mostly viewed as a coincidence, it is viewed as a property of mathematics. The confidence in this statement is that mathematics is *the* exact science.

There have been two primary schools of philosophical thought as to on what grounds we should believe in the exactness of mathematics, *intuitionism*, and *formalism*. These viewpoints are often diametrically opposed, but (as of 1912) they have come to the common agreement that the exact validity of mathematical laws are not laws of nature: the intuitionist says that the validity lies in the human intellect, the formalist says purely on the paper upon which the mathematics is written.

Let us begin with the intuitionist approach. We can find an early example in Kant. For Kant, the axioms of arithmetic and geometry were *synthetic a priori judgements*, e.g. judgements independent of experience and not capable of analytic demonstration, which explained their unquestionable exactness in the world of experience, and in the world of abstract thought; disproving arithmetical and geometrical laws experimentally was, to Kant, unthinkable.

The formalist instead argues that human reason cannot really picture the mathematical objects it studies, i.e. of exact straight lines, or numbers larger than 10, and therefore mathematical entities such as 'a straight line', or 'the number two thousand and forty five' do not exist in nature, nor even in our conception of nature. When humans derive statements from other axiomatic statements, we may believe we have derived *truth*, but to a formalist this notion is just a pure sensation of delight arising from the knowledge that such derivations can be projected into properties of the real world. Formalists do not care about truth, but merely deriving meaningless series of relations, which only have mathematical existence once a game of 'symbolic relations', or mathematical laws, has been fixed, thus forming a `symbolic logic`. The desire for precise relationships means usual spoken languages lack the precision for formalists, who try to avoid the use of ordinary language in mathematics. Which symbolic relations one accepts is irrelevant to the formalist: it is the job of the philosopher to determine which laws can be projected onto nature, the job of the anthropologist or psychologist to determine which laws give us a `sensation of delight`.

Nineteenth century mathematics seemed to yield a victory for the formalists. For it was seen that various mathematical theories could be translated from one domain to another: statements of projective geometry remain true if one interchanges the notion of `point` and `line`, and statements of arithmetic remained true over other number systems. Thus to the mathematician, considering only the logical form of arguments was relevent to mathematical content. An even greater blow was dealt by the discovery of non Euclidean geometry, under which standard geometrical facts can be projected. For instance, statements true in Euclidean geometry corresponded to projective geometry statements, and statements in projective geometry could be converted back to Euclidean form. Thus Kant's conception of the apriori nature of space began to fall apart.

Nonetheless, a neo-intuitionism has begun to arise in recent years, obtained by abandoning Kant's apriori conception of space, but adhering even more resolution to Kant's apriori conception of *time*. We percieve the moments of life as occuring in time, qualitatively, at different moments, which are reunited by the fundamental phenomenon of the conception of time, which is the fundamental phenomenon of mathematical thinking. This intuition creates not only our intuition of discrete units (and thus all finite numbers), but also an intuition of `between-ness`, which gives us the lienar continuum.
