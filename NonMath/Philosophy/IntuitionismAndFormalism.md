## Notes

*Science* is the systemic catologuing the laws of nature by which certain phenomena *cause* certain phenomena. The power that science leads to man is the ability to bring about certain primary phenomena, which may be difficult to achieve directly, by evoking other phenomena connected by science as a cause for this primary phenomena. Mankind can create order in the universe by isolating causal sequences of phenomena from other causes, as well as introducing other phenomena caused by it's own activity. Most important of this is the phenomena of *measuring* and *counting*.

Often natural laws connected to measurement can only be understood to hold up to a certain degree of approximation or error, and it is often our ability to measure and count objects to a greater degree of accuracy which induces new theories of science. The exceptions to thes rules have been the laws of arithmetic and geometry, and of rigid bodies and celestial mechanics, which have resisted most improvements in accurate measurements. Though for the latter this is mostly viewed as a coincidence, it is viewed as a property of mathematics. The confidence in this statement is that mathematics is *the* exact science.

There have been two primary schools of philosophical thought as to on what grounds we should believe in the exactness of mathematics, *intuitionism*, and *formalism*. These viewpoints are often diametrically opposed, but (as of 1912) they have come to the common agreement that the exact validity of mathematical laws are not laws of nature: the intuitionist says that the validity lies in the human intellect, the formalist says purely on the paper upon which the mathematics is written.

Let us begin with the intuitionist approach. We can find an early example in Kant. For Kant, the axioms of arithmetic and geometry were *synthetic a priori judgements*, e.g. judgements independent of experience and not capable of analytic demonstration, which explained their unquestionable exactness in the world of experience, and in the world of abstract thought; disproving arithmetical and geometrical laws experimentally was, to Kant, unthinkable.

The formalist instead argues that human reason cannot really picture the mathematical objects it studies, i.e. of exact straight lines, or numbers larger than 10, and therefore mathematical entities such as 'a straight line', or 'the number two thousand and forty five' do not exist in nature, nor even in our conception of nature. When humans derive statements from other axiomatic statements, we may believe we have derived *truth*, but to a formalist this notion is just a pure sensation of delight arising from the knowledge that such derivations can be projected into properties of the real world. Formalists do not care about truth, but merely deriving meaningless series of relations, which only have mathematical existence once a game of 'symbolic relations', or mathematical laws, has been fixed, thus forming a 'symbolic logic'. The desire for precise relationships means usual spoken languages lack the precision for formalists, who try to avoid the use of ordinary language in mathematics. Which symbolic relations one accepts is irrelevant to the formalist: it is the job of the philosopher to determine which laws can be projected onto nature, the job of the anthropologist or psychologist to determine which laws give us a 'sensation of delight'.

Nineteenth century mathematics seemed to yield a victory for the formalists. For it was seen that various mathematical theories could be translated from one domain to another: statements of projective geometry remain true if one interchanges the notion of 'point' and 'line', and statements of arithmetic remained true over other number systems. Thus to the mathematician, considering only the logical form of arguments was relevent to mathematical content. An even greater blow was dealt by the discovery of non Euclidean geometry, under which standard geometrical facts can be projected. For instance, statements true in Euclidean geometry corresponded to projective geometry statements, and statements in projective geometry could be converted back to Euclidean form. Thus Kant's conception of the apriori nature of space began to fall apart.

Nonetheless, a neo-intuitionism has begun to arise in recent years, obtained by abandoning Kant's apriori conception of space, but adhering even more resolution to Kant's apriori conception of *time*. We percieve the moments of life as occuring in time, qualitatively, at different moments, which are reunited by the fundamental phenomenon of the conception of time, which is the fundamental phenomenon of mathematical thinking. This intuition creates not only our intuition of discrete units (and thus all finite numbers), but also an intuition of 'between-ness', which gives us the linear continuum, and the idea of 'unity', which gives us the infinite ordinal number $\omega$. But we cannot necessarily discretize from the continuum, i.e. because we have no way of thinking of infinitely many things at once from the continuum. Mathematics is precisely this languageless intuition, and 'written mathematics' is only written mathematics in the sense that it assists the mathematical memory, or enables other individuals to share the mathematics going on in another's mind.

While formalism regulates what is 'true mathematics' to the psychologists, for practical purposes it must relegate it's work to a certain few sets of axiom systems that it percieves will probably be seen as 'true', for instance, the axioms of set theory. From this axiom system the formalist will eventually prove a principle of induction, a fact intuitively true for the mathematics of the intuitionists. But this means the formalist will never be able to justify a choice of axioms by a proof of non-contradictoryness of their theory, for in order to conclude a contradiction will never arise, the formalist would have to justify an infinite number of statements, and thus implicitly assume the principle of induction.

On finitary problems, the formalists and intuitionists differ only in their method, but on problems of the infinite the results differ. Intuitionists only deal with denumerable sequences of objects, and their unity cannot be decomposed into infinitely many discrete elements. For instance, the theory of cardinality of infinite objects breaks down. As an example, the continuum hypothesis, i.e. whether $\#(\mathbb{R}) = \aleph_1$, has no meaning whatsoever to an intuitionist, since intuition cannot break down the continuum $\mathbb{R}$ into a set of points in order to consider it's cardinality, and similarily, the construction of $\aleph_1$ as the collection of all denumerable ordinals cannot be broken down into it's original elements in order to consider it's cardinality. Nonetheless, it is possible to consider some results. We might ask whether it is possible to find a process which assigns a distinct countable ordinal to every sequence of digits (in the language of the formalist, to construct a function $f: [0,1] \to \aleph_1$). The intuitionist would answer in the negative; TODO I Don't Understand this argument.
