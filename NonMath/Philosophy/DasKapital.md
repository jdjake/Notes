## Chapter Notes

### First Edition Preface

The main goal of Das Kapital is to determine the economic laws of motion in modern society. In Economics, we do not have microscopes to isolate and thus identify the basic components on which economics laws isolate, nor 'pure reagants' which can be used to isolate the pure laws of motion. Instead, we must use the power of *abstraction* to find forms (the essence of things behind the appearance) to identify the economics, such as the commodity form, the value form, the money form, and so on. England is the 'purest' form of the capitalist system during Marx's time, and thus provides the purest place with which to test the structure of Marx's theory.

The economic formulation of society is a process of natural history, and so individuals here are only viewed as the personal embodiment of class interests and relations. The passing of orders of the order of economic relations is indifferent to the desire of individuals. Human will, consciousness, and intelligence are determined by these relations. An individual is thus not to be held accountable for the relations they embody, even if they may subjectively be able to identify themselves as higher than these relations.

### Second Edition Postface

Standard political economy views capitalism as the absolute and ultimate form of social development. This can only appear to be true while class struggle between the proletariat and the Bourgeois is undeveloped, or only manifests in sporadic and isolated phenomena. For instance, in England, the primary production of Bourgeois economics as a science occurred in the 1820-1830s. This was possible because large scale industry was not yet predominant, so not much class struggle occurred. And a more predominant class struggle was in the foreground of the times, between the feudal aristocracy who owned land in England, and industrial capital (e.g. the Corn Laws, which taxed the import of food in the UK, benefiting British land owners).

In the 1830s, class struggle began to emerge between the Proletariat and Bourgeois. This stopped the development of unprejudiced, scientific political economy. Principles were then accepted Bourgeois economists by whether they were useful to the Bourgeois, or harmful. Men who claimed scientific standing tried to harmonize Bourgeois political economy, and the claims of the proletariat, e.g. John Stuart Mill. But this is not possible, there is a contradiction between the class interests.

One of the most parts of Marx's analysis is that he identifies the necessary facts of the present order of economic relations, while also showing that these relations are shifting, and will eventually pass over into other phenomena. This is the dialectic method: the form of dialectic materialism Marx uses includes in it's analysis of a phenomena also the analysis of it's negation, of its destruction, inevitable because things are always in a fluid state of motion.
