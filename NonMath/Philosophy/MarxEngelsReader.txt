Dialectical Materialism - a general world-view of which historical materialism is the application to human history. Marx and Engels purely studied historical materialism, and the more general view is attributed to Russian and Communist Marxism.

Main point of Marxism: Historical Materialism

- Whereas 'utopian' socialists visualized a socialist reorganization society as something that *ought* to be realized, the materialist conception of history states that the human historical process moves towards anticapitalism revolution ushering in socialism or communism.

	- Historical materialism emerged from Hegel's idealist conception of history. Hegel represents history as the self-realization of spirit / god, a self-creative energy imbued with a drive to become conscious of itself. The historical process involves the repeated overcoming of spirit's "alienation" from itself, when spirit perceives the world as *other* from itself. The process terminates when spirit finally becomes fully "at home with itself in its otherness", recognizing the entirety of the world as spirit.

	- Ludwig Feuerbach, came to see history by twisting the concept of alienation on it's head. Instead of man being self-alienated god, god is self-alienated man. When man imagines and worships an idealized image of itself in heaven, they become alienated from themselves. To overcome alienation, man must take god back into himself, frecognized that mankind is the proper object of care, love, and worship.

	- Marx, inspired by Hegel and Feuerbach, came ot see Feurbach's notion of alienation in other areas of the world, i.e. the state being an alienated concept of social power,certain economic systems the process of alienating mankind's productive capacity from themselves (a man's desire to actualize oneself through labour can be exploited).
