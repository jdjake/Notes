- "It is not an accident, or a silly tradition that we work through Plies in the order of positions, i.e. beginning with the 1st position. It is easier to do a plie in the 2nd position, if you do it carelessly. But it is easier to teach a correct plie in the 1st position.

	When you stand in the 1st position your balance is less firm. You have to make a certain effort to keep the vertical axis around which the balance of the dancer is built. This forces control of the muscles, not to project the buttocks when squatting. The whole body is better concentrated, the position is correct; this is the foundation for any plie."

PLIE

- Distribute weight of body equally on each foot
- Demi Plie - No lifting heel off floor. Good practice to stretch achilles tendon.
