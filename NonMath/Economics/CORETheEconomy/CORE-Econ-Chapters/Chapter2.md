# Chapter 2: Technology, Population, and Growth

Basic theory (An Essay on the Principle of Population, 1798): Sustained Income per Capita growth is impossible. As income grows, population grows to match or surpass this income growth, which hampers income growth. This balances out until an equilibrium is reached, where humans are just able to earn enough to survive and produce offspring, and live in no more luxury, i.e. a *subsistence income*. Thus poverty for the majority is inevitable.

After Malthus' Essay, England experienced the industrial revolution (a complex combination of technological, cultural, and intellectual developments over the 19th century) which caused income growth to outpace population growth, 'escaping the Malthusian trap'. Moreover, population growth seems to taper off as income continues to grow today, which further offsets the Malthusian trap.

Why did the industrial revolution happen / What were the causes of technological change?

- Robert Allen: England had a high cost of labour, and low cost of energy sources like coal, which drove the need for technological advance, and it’s eventual widespread adoption.
- Joel Mokyr: The enlightenment and the scientific revolution meant both new sciences were developed, and they were trusted by the Bourgeoisie, who could use these sciences practically. The cost of labor and energy sources were 'a steering wheel, rather than a motor' for innovation, i.e. not the main cause.
- David Landes: European innovation pulled ahead of Chinese innovation because Chinese culture favored stability over change, and the Chinese state stifled innovation.
- Gregory Clark: England culturally valued Hard work, and saving money for future generations. (Related to Max Webers argument that the protestant work ethic was tied to 'the spirit of capitalism').
- Kenneth Pomeranz: England just had more coal, and was able to exploit their access to agriculture in its colonies to further industrialize.
- Prasannan Parthasarathi: The economy and market structures of India were developed just as much as Europe by the time of the industrial revolution. He argues that England’s trade protectionism enabled a market monopoly which allowed them to innovate, and after colonization, Indian markets were unable to take the same path.

Other countries took different routes to escape the Malthusian trap. Germany focused on steel and other heavy industries rather than textiles via their institutions of strong governments and powerful banks, Japan outcompeted the UK in the Asian textiles market during this time b/c of it being closer to greater Asia than the UK, while selectively adapting certain capitalist institutions.

*Building Economic Models (Stagnation and Escaping The Malthusian Trap)*

A model is a scientific tool that allows us to distinguish features of the economy that are important to a particular question we want to answer, while discarding unimportant details.

- e.g. Malthus’ conclusion on the inevitability of poverty was a conclusion to a question based on a model, namely a relationship between income growth and population growth.
- An *equilibrium* is a self sustaining system. The system itself may change, but the property we are concentrating on remains constant.

To apply a model, we begin by making assumptions / hypotheses about how people behave, and the affects of these actions on the overall system. Often the outcome is an equilibrium.

Our first model we will construct will answer the question of why stagnation occurs, how capitalist institutions promoted firms to advanced technologically, which enabled an escape from stagnation:

- Let us begin by making some simplifying assumptions.
    - The price of non labor inputs are the same for all firms.
    - All laborers are equally productive.
    - All firms share equal knowledge of technology.
    - Firms are equally risky.
    - Technology only affects the amount of human labor and coal required to produce a given resource.
    - Firms try and maximize profit.
    - Cost of labor and coal is fixed.
- To understand how technology affects the output, we introduce the concept of a *production function*, which describes the amount of output that can be produced from any given input (the *production factors)*. Different technologies give rise to different production functions. We have assumed that the relevant inputs in this model are the amount of human labor, and the amount of coal power required to produce a given output, so these are the variables in the production function.
- We also introduce the phenomenon of *innovation rent / Schumpeterian rents* (the theory of innovation rent / creative destruction was introduced by economist Joseph Schumpeter). In general, *economic rent* is profit made

- the difference in profit between the *best option* available to an individual, and the second best option available to that individual (your *reservation option*). This rent is often caused by limited access to a material / technology not available to others. *Innovation rent* is economic rent obtained by switching to a different technology. In this case, this normally occurs because others do not have access / have not adopted some technology.
    - As an innovation is adopted by most firms in an industry, the greater economy will adapt so that the innovation rent decreases. In particular, firms that did not adopt this innovation will see their profits decline, and so they will go bankrupt. Thus we see *creative* in which labor / resources confined to a firm that refuses to adapt is released into the greater economy, and can thus be used in new combinations. E*volutionary economics* is the economic study of innovation, the change of social norms, and the development of institutions.
    - While innovation is often attributed to be the main cause of economic growth, the sluggishness with which innovations are adopted causes upswings and downswings in the economy. The beneficial circular flow of disruption must also be destructive — i.e. economic growth will not see the benefits of creative innovation if it it’s regulated to R&D departments in large corporations.
- If we assume a fixed wage *w*, and a fixed price of coal *p*, then given a given family of technologies that give production functions *P(i)* requiring *L(i)* units of labor and *R(i)* units of coal, firms will choose the *i*th technology that minimizes *w L(i) + p R(i)*. Thus the relative cost of labor and coal determines which technologies a firm will be encouraged to adopt.
    - In the 1600s, the cost of human labor was larger in France than England. But in the 1800s the cost of human labor was larger in England than in France, which might explain why England became the center point of the industrial revolution, rather than France.
        - What then explains the eventual adoption of industrial technology in France? One option is that new technological advances *dominated* the previous ones (they required both less human labor and less coal). Or wages rose in France, which motivated firms to adopt new technologies.

Now let us analyze a model of farming that follows Malthus’ thoughts.

- We assume that only the amount of labor required is relevant to the production of food, and all labor is equally productive. Thus in this model, the production function just gives the amount of units of labor required to produce a unit of food. We can therefore write the amount of units of food *F* produced for a given unit *L* of labor as a function of *L*.
    - We also assume a *diminishing return* on the average productivity of labor. If the amount of land that can be used to produce food is fixed, then we cannot get the same amount of food for each increase in the amount of labor we use. Even if we could get new land, it will likely be less productive than the land that was chosen for a smaller population of farmers. Thus *F/L* decreases as *L* increases.
    - Malthus’ second assuming is that an increase in *surplus,* i.e. an increase in the amount of food produced above subsistence level, leads to more offspring being produced. Thus if the average amount productivity *F/L* rises above a certain threshold quantity *S*, then *L* increases as more children are produced, and if *****F/L* is below *S*, then *L* decreases as the population is not able to support itself.
    - But this means that as time passes, *F/L* will always tend to the equilibrium *S.*
    - If the productivity of labor increases due to some technological change, e.g. the discovery of a new seed, then the population will increase, but will remain living at a subsistence rate. This is *Malthus’ Law,* and was a fact almost universally believed around the turn of the century, e.g. such that Malthus’ response to the Irish potato famine was that this was a natural course correction as to the overpopulation of the Irish people, and Churchill that the cause of the Bengal famine was caused by them reproducing too much. H.G. Wells said that “humanity spent the great gifts of science as rapidly as it got them in a mere insensate multiplication of the common life”.
    - One can actually use Malthus’ model to provide an explanation for civil unrest in England. The Black Death killed off a large population of farmers, which meant that the average productivity of those that remain increased. Farmers were therefore better off, and even non agricultural laborers were better off since their employers had to compete with farming productivity by raising wages. Nonetheless, when the labor supply returned to normal, the labor supply increased, and wages were lowered as a result.
    - If we make the model a little more sophisticated, for instance, including land in the productivity function, then this might explain why landowners become better off as populations increase due to the diminishing rate of productivity of labor for a fixed amount of land.
- Malthusian assumptions now no longer hold.
    - From the 1300s to the 1500s, and in the 1700s, average wages were clearly negatively correlated with population size. But starting in the 1800s, the ratio of population to average wages began to increase linearly. Humanity had escaped the Malthusian trap. In the 1700s, technology such as the spinning jenny and the steam engine caused many to lose their jobs, displacing many workers. Innovation continued into the 1800s, which caused businesses to experience great profits, and thus expand, increasing the demand for labor. This caused the average wage of people to begin to increase as well. This power increased as the right to vote was obtained, and union power arose, which continued this rise in wage increases.
    - As individuals become richer, it seems that fertility rates fall. Malthus did not see that modern culture and societal changes mean families often have a preferred number of children, regardless of their income status.
- The Malthusian model may have possibly explained some previous phenomena in human history, but it no longer accounts for the way that human societies develop over time.
