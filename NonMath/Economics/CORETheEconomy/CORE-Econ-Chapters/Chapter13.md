# Chapter 13: Economic Fluctuations and Unemployment

Most of the models in this book are *********************microeconomics models*********************, i.e. they model the interactions between individuals. The concern here is to pursue private interests, i.e. to ensure that interactions result in Pareto optimal outcomes. But in macroeconomics, more broad goals are of interest, like determining the effects of public policy, and determining what causes inequality, innovation, as well as ensuring public goods are met, like sustainable environmental effects. We will analyze some of these in the last few units of this book.

*Unemployment Sucks*

- Unemployment is correlated with higher stress (e.g. as measured by the number of searches for anti-stress medicine on Google).
- Being fired leads to a greater amount of unhappiness than losing an equivalent amount of income, i.e. because it hurts both your self esteem as well as your income.
    - (Clark and Oswald estimate that on average, $15,000 worth of monetary compensation per month is equivalent to the amount of unhappiness lost from losing a job, which really only gives a financial loss of $2000 per month).

*Recessions*

- A recession is a decline in economic activity, seeming to take place once every 5 to 6 years (the business cycle), which could take the form of several definitions (there is no universally standard definition):
    - The rate of growth in the economic sector has slowed down - the recession is over when the rate begins to pick back up.
    - The output of the economy has decreased - the recession is over when the output picks back up to ‘normal’ levels (and this definition is still soft because economists differ on what they consider ‘normal levels’ of economic output).
- *Okun’s Law* is the empirical observation that the rate of growth of GDP is correlated with employment rate. Taking a linear regression to unemployment rate as a function of economic growth, we can associate with each country an *Okun’s coefficient*, which is the regression slope of the resulting linear function. Okun's law says this coefficient is negative.
- During the Great Recession of 2009, some countries experienced greater unemployment rate than that which Okun’s law predicted (e.g. Spain, Japan, and the US), whereas other countries experienced a smaller unemployment rate (e.g. Germany).

***GDP***

The GDP of a country is the aggregate output of all production in a country. There are three different ways to measure this:

- *Spending:* The amount spent on the products of that country, by individuals in that country, individuals abroad, and businesses / governmental organizations, and so on.
- *Production:* The amount of ***********value added*********** by industries in a country, measured by the difference in the price of a good produced by an industry vs. the cost of the goods, services, and labor used as inputs to the industry.
- ******Income******: The sum of wages of individuals, profits of companies, and taxes received by the government.

If you do the calculations correctly, these three quantities should all be the same.

Here’s an example. Consider a hypothetical country with a cotton industry, a cloth industry, and a shirt industry. The shirt industry sells a unit of shirts for $100, buying the required cloth to produce those shirts for $50. The cloth industry in turn buys the required cotton to produce these shirts for $30. We can calculate the GDP of this industry in the different ways:

- Each unit of shirt sold costs $100, so the GDP is 100$ times the number of shirts sold.
- The shirt industry produces $50 of value, the cloth industry produces $20 of value, and the cotton industry produces $30 of value, for each unit of item they sell. Thus the GDP is 50$ times the number of shirts produced, $20 times the number of units of cloth produced, and $30 times the number of units of cotton produced.

We must be careful here when we introduce *******imports******* and *******exports******* from a country. Suppose someone in China buys rice from someone in Japan. This counts as ************Japanese GDP************ since the rice was produced in Japan. Thus when counting GDP through spending, exports are taken into account, but imports are not taken into account. If the cotton was instead imported into the country, the GDP production in that country would be $80 per shirt instead of $100 per shirt.

Because these three quantities are equal, we can view recessions in three different ways:

- A recession is a period of decreased economic production.
- A recession is a period of decrease income into a country.
- A recession is a period of decreased **expenditure**.

The third is the strangest. One sees that a recession happens just because ************people are spending less money.************

From the perspective of expenditure, we can divide the GDP into several components:

- Consumption (C): Goods and services purchased by households. This can include goods like food that are used immediately, or goods like cars that last for a longer stretch of time (these are called *************durable goods*************). In almost all economies consumption forms the largest percentage of GDP.
- Investment (I): Spending by businesses on new equipment / new commercial buildings, and (QUESTION: IS THIS TRUE) spending by individuals on housing, as well as *******inventories*******, the value of goods that are made by a company, but not yet sold on the market.
- Government Spending on Goods and Services (G): Money spend by the government on goods and services, e.g. on the wages of public officials, office equipment used in public buildings, the building of roads, the expenditure on healthcare, and so on.

To avoid double counting, pensions / unemployment benefits are ***not*** included in government spending - these funds would be included when they are spent, e.g. in Consumption or Investment.
- Exports (X): Total price of goods produced domestically and sold abroad.
- Imports (M): Total price of goods purchased domestically that were manufactured abroad.
- The ***********Net Export,*********** or *************Trade Balance*************, is the difference between exports and imports. The Balance is in deficit if more is imported than exported, and in surplus if more is exported than imported.

The GDP is then defined to be the *aggregate demand* of the economy, i.e. C + I + G + X - M.

We should be careful when using GDP as a statistic about the economy. In some contexts, GDP per capita is a better measurement, or perhaps a notion of GDP taking environmental degradation into consideration (*************green growth*************).

*********************Economic Fluctuations: Consumption Smoothing of Individuals*********************

How do individuals deal with economic fluctuations, or *******shocks*******. We can distinguish between two types of such changes, personal changes (i.e. changes in income because of an injury) and economic changes (e.g. when a drought reduces the overall output of crops in an economy, or a war breaks out).

Some individuals save in good times in case bad times happen. This is **************self insurance**************. Other households more fortunate than others might also help out a household hit by bad luck. This is *****coinsurance*****. The latter is built on trust and reciprocity. Coinsurance is less effective to deal with economic changes, which tend to affect an entire economy at once, but is often still essential, since some households will be impacted less than other households. An example of coinsurance was the lessened effect of the 2009 recession on unemployment rates in Germany: as a result of government policy and agreements between employers and employees, many individuals were paid as if they were working more hours than they actually were working. Thus despite aggregate demand decreasing (so that less work needed to be done), aggregate consumption did not decrease, which balanced things out.

Individuals often act to ******************smooth consumption******************, i.e. because of the decreasing marginal rate of consumption. We saw this in our analysis of borrowing, where individuals preferred to borrow money from the future in order to even out their consumption relative to the present. This leads to a ***************************consumption smoothing model***************************: individuals have expectations about future income, which affects their level of spending in the present, e.g. by borrowing, saving, and so on, in order to smooth consumption. When such individuals encounter economic shocks, they evaluate how the shock will affect future expectations (i.e. is the shock temporary, or permanent).

Of course, there is so much unpredictable information in this model that individuals are unable to make perfect predictions about the future. Individuals are also unable to smooth consumption as much as they would like, i.e. because of credit limitations (individuals who most need to smooth consumption are often poor, so cannot borrow as much as they need), limited co-insurance, or just plain weakness of will when individuals plan something they know will be beneficial in the long run, but don’t act upon such plans.

*******************Economic Fluctuations of Firms*******************

Whereas individuals are motivated to smooth consumption, firms are ***not*** motivated to smooth investment. Firms tend to act to increase profits whenever they see the opportunity to do so. This explains the boom / bust cycle of investment: as firms see opportunities to make a profit, they investment in waves in various industries. This can lead either to vicious or virtuous circles: If firms decide to invest, they spend money, creating new consumers of products which might expand the demand of the products the firms invest in. Optimism about the future / the behavior of others leads to greater investment. On the other hand, if firms perceive there to be no profits to be made in an industry, they are unlikely to invest, so that less money will circulate through the economy, and thus less individuals will be able to consume products.

*********Inflation*********

How do we determine inflation? There are so many factors influencing the price of a chocolate bar (e.g. supply / demand / innovation) that it is difficult to determine whether the change in price of a chocolate bar is simply because *****************************things are more expensive now*****************************.

One method economists use involves the ********************Consumer Price Index********************, a weighted average of the price of goods and services, weighted by the amount the average person uses those goods, which is meant to reflect the *************************************************average amount of money individuals have to spend*************************************************. The index includes imports, but excludes exports, since domestic individuals do not spend money on exports. Since the various factors influencing the price of individual goods are likely averaged out by taking a bundle of a large number of goods, we can use the consumer price index to evaluate how expensive it is to live. The rate of change of the CPI is called ******CPI Inflation******.

Another method is the ************GDP Deflator,************ a price index which accounts for the changes in price in all domestically produced goods and services.
