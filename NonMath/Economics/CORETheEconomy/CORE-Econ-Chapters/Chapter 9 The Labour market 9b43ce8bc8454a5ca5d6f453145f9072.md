# Chapter 9: The Labour market

In this chapter, we try and analyze the relationship between the determination of the real wage and the level of employment in a society, as a business interacts with the greater economy. Labor operates differently to the analysis of undifferentiated commodities in a perfectly competitive economy. We have already seen some differences in Chapter 6, by acknowledging the fact that employees can only purchase the *time* of an employee, and not the product of their labour. Our models in this Chapter will again observe what we saw in that chapter, i.e. that supply tends to exceed demand in the labour market.

We will consider a model of a firm in which the only input to production is labor. Thus the profit of a firm is determined by the *nominal,* or *money wage* paid to workers in exchange for labour, the *price* at which the products of labour are sold, and the *productivity* of workers. Our goal is to determine how the *real wage* is determined, i.e. the nominal wage, relative to the price level of other goods in the economy.

We consider a firm that operates according to the following procedure:

- First, the *nominal wage* offered to employees is set (perhaps by a HR Department). We have seen a model of how this is set in Chapter 6. Using the price of other comparable goods in the economy, the reservation wages offered by other firms / welfare, and the unemployment rate in the economy (how much employees will be penalized by being fired), the HR department can choose a wage which maximizes the total productivity to wage ratio.

Question: Could raising the price of goods beyond what is offered by other firms perhaps increase productivity to the point where the firm is making more money than other firms?

Question: Is the firm a price setter?
- Given the nominal wage determined, the firm (lets say, the Marketing Department) then sets the *price* of goods produced, given the demand curve of these goods. This is essentially determining the optimal markup products should be sold at, relative to the price of labor.
- Finally, once the price is set, and the demand for products is estimated, one can calculate the total units of labour time that much be acquired by the department to produce the optimal amount of products. This determines the number of employees the firm will hire.

*The Wage Setting Curve*

One of the oldest questions in economics is how the average wage of workers is effected by the unemployment rate of a country. In Chapter 6, we analyzed a model which predicted the existence of the *wage curve*, a relationship between the *real wage* of employees in terms of the unemployment rate of the economy. We will use the existence of such a curve in this model, as well as the fact that the unemployment rate determines the *labour productivity rate.*

There are other models of unemployment, such as the *work / shirk model*. Here the existence of a wage curve is assumed, and that for real wages above this wage curve, employees work, and below this wage curve, employees *shirk*, i.e. they do not work at all. We will come back to this model in later chapters.

Question: Does the work / shirk model essentially determines the precise wage at which the employer should pay employees?

Question: 9.2 Explain why a rise in the unemployment rate shifts the best response function but not the wage-setting curve.

Question: Real wages should be wages normalized by the expected utility per dollar earned?

Recall from Chapter 7 and 8 that a firm chooses a price so that the *relative markup $\mu$,* i.e. the percentage increase in price from the cost of productive, is equal to $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the elasticity of the product. Now in our model, the only cost of production is labor. If $\lambda$ denotes the productivity of labor (the cost of labor relative to the amount of a good produced, then we therefore find that at a given nominal wage $W$ and a given level of productivity $\lambda$, a price is chosen so that

$$
\mu = \frac{P - W / \lambda}{P} = 1 - \frac{W}{\lambda P}.
$$

Thus $W/P$ satisfies the equation

$$
W/P = \lambda(1 - \mu).
$$

which, in some sense, approximates the real wage $R$, and so we assume it is equal to the real wage of the economy, i.e. $R = W/P$.

We have now identified two curves. The first, the *wage setting curve*, gave the real wage and productivity rate of workers at a given employment level in the economy, e.g. it allows us to write

$$
\lambda = f(E) \quad\text{and}\quad R = g(E)
$$

for some functions $f$ and $g$, where $E$ is the employment level of the economy. Conversely, the *price setting curve* determined the real wage as a function of labor productivity and the elasticity of a product, i.e. allowing us to write

$$
R = \lambda(1 - 1/\varepsilon)
$$

Putting these two sets of equations together, we find that

$$
g(E) = R = \lambda(1 - 1/\varepsilon) = f(E) (1 - 1/\varepsilon)
$$

Assuming $f$, $g$, and $\varepsilon$ are appropriately regular, we can solve this equation to determine the employment rate $E$ uniquely, i.e. at a Nash equilibrium where neither the HR department, nor the marketing department can improve their strategy without extraneous properties of the economy changing.

Question: What new is said in this chapter vs. in Chapter 6 about the necessity of unemployment.

Let us see how the employment level changes if the *aggregate demand* of the economy decreases. This often results in a shift from the Nash equilibrium, in which individuals are fired, but would want to be hired at the current price level (*involuntary unemployment*). Eventually, to return to a Nash equilibrium, an efficient HR department would notice this involuntary unemployment, and take advantage of it by lowering the real wage of employees. Given the ways that our model evolves, the following cyclical system would occur:

- The HR department would lower wages.
- Lower wages would lower the prices of goods,
- Lower prices would result in higher demand, which expands unemployment.

However, this is not always what is observed in practice, perhaps due to the following explanations:

- Lowering wages might hurt the morale of existing employees, reducing productivity. Thus HR departments might not start the process of lowering wages as optimally as the cutthroat model above. We saw that employers are reluctant to lower wages in Chapter 6?
- Marketing departments might not be willing to lower prices drastically, since individuals might hesitate buying a product, thinking that falling prices might continue, and they could save money by buying later.

There is a way that governments can intervene to prevent this kind of procedure from happening. One option is to adopt policies to increase the spending of the government, increasing aggregate demand independently of the acts of individual businesses. Interest rates can be lowered, or reduce the rate of taxation. This can result in a more rapid tendency to equilibrium than just waiting for the market to evolve independently of governmental intervention.

Now suppose that *immigration* happened. Let’s see what happens to the wage setting curve. First, unemployment levels rise, this raises the hazard of getting fired, thus lowering wages. Thus the short term effect of immigration is bad for those currently living in a country. In the long run however, the increased profit that firms make as a result will restore the real wage and return the economy to it’s initial rate of employment

Question: I need the math here everything is so fuzzy r/n.

What about the effects of *unions*. In this situation, wages are not set purely by a business, but are negotiated via a contract between a labor union and an employer. This results in a higher wage setting curve since now not only can employers fire lazy employees, but labor unions can `fire employers' temporarily. Thus there is a hazard both for not being productive, but also for setting low wages. The ability for a union to do this is of course relative to it's power: in countries where unions are not as respected, unions might have less power. In countries where `scabbing' is a severe violation of a social norm, the bargaining power of unions will be much higher.

Let’s model this as follows. First, unions set wages. Then employees set the terms of how hard they want employees to work. Then employees decide by choosing how hard to work. The result is that overall profits will be lower, but wages will be higher for the remaining employees, and the employment level will decrease. This seems to indicate that unions harm workers, but this does not seem to be the case in practice, i.e. more bargaining power does not seem to decrease employment levels in practice. Perhaps giving employees more of a voice causes them to work harder, and thus increase the productivity as a result?

Question: Do the math

Education / Training increases the value $\lambda$. Competition is uneffected, so the increase in productivity does not increase relative prices. But this means that the real wage must increase, and the employment level must increase simultaneously.

Todo: Wage subsidy analysis.

Next let’s see how *inequality* can be understood through this model. We assume a fixed number of capitalists, and a fixed number of the working class.

- *A larger fraction of the employees are without work (higher unemployment rate)*: The first kink shifts right.
- *The real wage falls (or equivalently, the markup rises) and nothing else changes*: The second kink shifts down.
- 

*Productivity rises and nothing else changes (real wages do not rise)*

: This implies that the markup rises, so again the second kink shifts down.
