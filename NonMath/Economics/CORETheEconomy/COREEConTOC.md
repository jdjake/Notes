> One says that we are so rich and they so poor because we are so good and they so bad; that is, we are hardworking, knowledgeable, educated, well governed, efficacious, and productive, and they are the reverse. The other says that we are so rich and they so poor because we are so bad and they so good: we are greedy, ruthless, exploitative, aggressive, while they are weak, innocent, virtuous, abused, and vulnerable.

> Consider the problem of predicting the shots made by an expert billiard player. It seems not at all unreasonable that excellent predictions would be yielded by the hypothesis that the billiard player made his shots as if he knew the complicated mathematical formulas that would give the optimum directions of travel, could estimate accurately by eye the angles, etc., describing the location of the balls, could make lightning calculations from the formulas, and could then make the balls travel in the direction indicated by the formulas. Our confidence in this hypothesis is not based on the belief that billiard players, even expert ones, can or do go through the process described. It derives rather from the belief that, unless in some way or other they were capable of reaching essentially the same result, they would not in fact be expert billiard players.
    - Milton Friedman.

‘If a workman moves from department Y to department X, he does not go because of a change in relative prices but because he is ordered to do so … the distinguishing mark of the firm is the suppression of the price mechanism. (‘The Nature of the Firm’, 1937)’

B]eing the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a [firm managed by its owners] frequently watch over their own … Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company. (The Wealth of Nations, 1776).

not everything in the contract is contractual.’ - Emile Dirkheim

Think about the prices determined by markets as messages. The increase in the price of US cotton shouted: ‘find other sources, and find new technologies appropriate for their use.’ Similarly, when the price of petrol rises, the message to the car driver is: ‘take the train’, which is passed on to the railway operator: ‘there are profits to be made by running more train services’. When the price of electricity goes up, the firm or the family is being told: ‘think about installing photovoltaic cells on the roof.’

Ethical forces are among those of which the economist has to take account.  Attempts have indeed been made to construct an abstract science with regard to the actions of an economic man who is under no ethical influences and who pursues pecuniary gain … selfishly. But they have not been successful. (*Principles of Economics*, 1890)

Now, how many of the devices adopted in ordinary life to that end would still be open to a seller in a market in which so-called ‘perfect competition’ prevails? I believe that the answer is exactly none. Advertising, undercutting, and improving (‘differentiating’) the goods or services produced are all excluded by definition—’perfect’ competition means indeed the absence of all competitive activities. (*[The Meaning of Competition](https://tinyco.re/1712601)*, 1946)

Economic
 rents and rent-seekers often have a bad name in economics. People 
disapprove because they think about rents as those arising from 
government-created monopolies (taxi licenses, intellectual property 
rights) or privately created monopolies. These rents indicate that the 
good or service will be sold at a price exceeding its marginal cost, and
 so the markets for these goods are not Pareto efficient.

But
 we have now seen the usefulness of some economic rents. They encourage 
innovation, provide incentives for employees to work hard, encourage new
 entrants to a market and thereby lower prices for consumers, and can 
bring an out-of-equilibrium market to a Pareto-efficient equilibrium.

**Econ Terms Dictionary**

- *Technology:* A process by which materials and labor are converted into outputs.
- *Natural experiment*: An empirical study where natural conditions allow one to observe two phenomena with most features controlled for by nature, not by any decision on behalf of the observers.
- *Model* - a simplified representation of a situation to explain correlation between phenomena.
- *Index* - A series of related quantities occurring at different times.
- *Real GDP*: GDP adjusted for inflation against a standard set of prices.
- *Purchasing Power Parity GDP:* GDP adjusted by purchasing power to account for the differing values of money in different countries. Again, this requires an independent measure of value.
- *Disposable Income*: Amount of money made by a person after taxes (money that can be used on goods and services).
- C*omparative Advantage*: an individual is more efficient at converting inputs into outputs.
- A*bsolute Advantage*: an individual has more access to relevant inputs than another individual.
- *Private Property*: Things you are free to use in any way you see fit, including giving them to someone else.
- *Capital Goods* are private, non labor inputs used to produce goods and services.
- *Firms*: Organizations for producing goods by purchasing labor from individuals. The inputs and outputs of firms are private property, converted into a profit by selling the outputs on the market.
- *Production Function:* A function measuring the amount of output obtained by some inputs.
- *Economic Rent / Innovation Rent*: The amount gained by choosing an option better than another option, often obtained as a result of having access to some resource unavailable to other individuals. *Innovation rent* is economic rent obtained by switching to a different technology. In this case, this normally occurs because others do not have access / have not adopted some technology.
- *Marginal Rate of Substitution:* The amount of a given good one would remain indifferent to substitution for another good.
- *Marginal Rate of Transformation:* The amount of a given good one one is constrained to substitute for another good (i.e. because of a limited budget, or a limited number of hours one is willing to work, and so on).
- *Residual* is the amount of money left over in production at a firm after whatever remains is used to pay employees, pay taxes. Can also be called the *profit*.
