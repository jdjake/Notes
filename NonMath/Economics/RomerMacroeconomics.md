### Chapter 0: Introduction

Macroeconomics is the study of the entire economy. It tries to answer questions such as "what causes economies to grow", "why is there unemployment", and "what causes inflation". The main tool of economics to answer such questions is the idea of a *model*, which isolates certain features of reality, and studies their consequences in isolation. We study many models, since some features of the economy may be crucial to one issue, but not to others.

### Chapter 1: The Solow Growth Model

In the first four chapters of this book, we will analyze the problem of economic growth. We start with a very simple, transparent model for studying this problem, the *Solow Growth Model*, developed by Solow (1956) and Swan (1956). Models that depart fundamentally from this model are best understood in comparison to this model. The principal conclusion of the model is that the accumulation of physical capital cannot account for the vast growth in output per person or geographic differences in output. The main conclusion will be that technological progress is almost surely to account for worldwide growth in income. But it does not account for differences in income for different countries.

The Solow model focuses on four quantities, output $Y$, capital $K$, labor $L$, and 'knowledge', or effectiveness of labor $A$. We have a production function $F$ of the form

$$ Y = F(K,AL) $$

The quantity $AL$ is called *effective labor*. Our assumption is that technology is only *labor augmenting*, or *Harrod neutral*. Conversely, a model with a production function of the form $Y = F(AK, L)$ is called *capital augmenting*, and a model with a production function of the form $Y = A F(K,L)$ is called *Hick's neutral*.

A critical assumption of the model is that it as *constant returns to scale*, i.e. for any $c > 0$,

$$ F(cK, cAL) = c F(K,AL). $$
